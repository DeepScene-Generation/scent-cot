## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a classic billiards room designed for leisurely play and social interaction. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a central pool table, a cue stand for organizing cues, and a spectator bench for seating. The user desires a classic style, with additional elements such as wall sconces for ambiance, a small table for drinks or snacks, a wall clock for timekeeping, and a rug to add warmth. The total number of objects should not exceed 15, ensuring each item is essential to the room's function and aesthetic.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to accommodate the user's requirements. The central area is designated for the pool table, serving as the focal point. The south wall is allocated for the cue stand, ensuring easy access without obstructing movement. The north wall is reserved for the spectator bench, providing a comfortable viewing area. The east and west walls are utilized for wall sconces to enhance lighting and ambiance. Additional elements like a side table and wall clock are strategically placed to complement the room's functionality and classic style.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central area, a classic-style pool table measuring 2.7 meters by 1.5 meters by 0.8 meters is recommended. The cue stand, with dimensions of 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.2 meters, is placed on the south wall. A spectator bench, measuring 1.8 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.5 meters, is positioned against the north wall. Classic brass wall sconces are mounted on the east and west walls, each measuring 0.14 meters by 0.065 meters by 0.151 meters. A side table, 0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.5 meters, is placed next to the spectator bench. A wall clock, 0.4 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.4 meters, is mounted on the east wall. A red wool rug, measuring 3.0 meters by 2.0 meters, is placed under the pool table to add warmth.

## 4. Scene Graph
The pool table is the central element of the room, placed in the middle to allow ample space for movement and gameplay. Its dimensions (2.7m x 1.5m x 0.8m) fit well within the room's size, and it is oriented with its longer side parallel to the north-south axis, facing the north wall. This placement ensures the pool table remains the focal point, aligning with the classic billiards room theme and providing balance and prominence.

The cue stand is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. Its compact size (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.2m) allows it to fit snugly without obstructing movement around the pool table. This placement ensures easy access for players and maintains the room's classic aesthetic by balancing the layout.

The spectator bench is positioned against the north wall, facing the pool table. Measuring 1.8 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.5 meters, it provides comfortable seating for viewers without disrupting the room's flow. Its placement ensures symmetry and optimal viewing for spectators, adhering to the classic style.

Wall sconces are mounted on the east and west walls, each facing the opposite wall. Their dimensions (0.14m x 0.065m x 0.151m) ensure they do not interfere with floor space. These sconces provide balanced lighting across the room, enhancing visibility and ambiance, which is crucial for a classic billiards room.

The side table is placed to the left of the spectator bench, against the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.5m) allow it to complement the bench's functionality by providing a convenient surface for drinks and snacks, maintaining balance and proportion within the room.

The wall clock is mounted on the east wall, facing the west wall. Its size (0.4m x 0.1m x 0.4m) ensures it is visible from all corners of the room, providing functionality without interfering with the existing wall sconce. This placement maintains the room's classic aesthetic and functionality.

The rug is placed under the pool table in the middle of the room. Its dimensions (3.0m x 2.0m) fit comfortably, adding warmth and visual interest to the space. The rug's placement respects the existing layout and enhances the overall design by anchoring the pool table in the room.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were strategically placed to ensure functionality and aesthetic appeal, adhering to the user's vision of a classic billiards room. The room's layout maintains balance and symmetry, with each object serving its intended purpose without spatial conflicts.
