## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions an industrial-style living space, emphasizing a gray fabric sofa, a metal coffee table with a marble top, and a vintage leather suitcase as central elements. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design aims to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing environment that supports relaxation and socializing. Additional elements such as a rug, floor lamp, and wall art are suggested to enhance the room's ambiance and align with the industrial theme.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional areas based on the user's requirements. The Sofa Area is designated for relaxation and socializing, featuring the gray fabric sofa. The Coffee Table Area provides a functional surface for drinks and decorative items, positioned centrally in front of the sofa. The Vintage Suitcase Area serves as a unique storage solution or side table, adding a nostalgic touch. Additional areas include the Rug Area for comfort and aesthetic appeal, the Lighting Area for ambient illumination, and the Wall Art Area for visual interest.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sofa Area, a gray fabric sofa measuring 2.2 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.8 meters is recommended to align with the industrial theme. The Coffee Table Area features a metal and marble coffee table, 1.2 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.45 meters, complementing the sofa. The Vintage Suitcase Area includes a leather suitcase, 0.8 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.3 meters, serving dual purposes. A dark gray wool rug, 2.5 meters by 1.5 meters, is suggested for the Rug Area. The Lighting Area includes a black metal floor lamp, 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.8 meters, while the Wall Art Area features a canvas piece, 1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 0.7 meters. An industrial-style metal shelf, 1.2 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.8 meters, is recommended for storage and display.

## 4. Scene Graph
The gray fabric sofa is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall, to create a cozy seating area that aligns with the industrial theme. Its dimensions (2.2m x 0.9m x 0.8m) ensure it fits comfortably, setting the tone for the room and leaving ample space for other furniture. The metal and marble coffee table is positioned in front of the sofa, maintaining accessibility and enhancing the room's functionality. Its size (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.45m) allows for adequate circulation space, complementing the sofa's industrial style.

The vintage leather suitcase is placed to the right of the sofa, serving as a side table or storage option. Its compact size (0.8m x 0.5m x 0.3m) ensures it does not obstruct movement, while its vintage charm adds warmth to the industrial theme. The dark gray wool rug is centrally placed under the coffee table, anchoring the seating area and providing comfort. Its dimensions (2.5m x 1.5m) fit well within the room, enhancing the aesthetic without overlapping other furniture.

The black metal floor lamp is positioned to the left of the sofa, providing lighting for the seating area and coffee table. Its height (1.8m) ensures it casts light effectively without obstructing movement. The wall art, a canvas piece, is placed on the north wall at eye level, enhancing visual balance and contributing to the industrial aesthetic. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.7m) allow it to fit comfortably without overwhelming the space. Finally, the industrial-style metal shelf is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. Its placement optimizes storage and display functionality while maintaining the room's industrial aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The layout accommodates all objects without spatial conflicts, ensuring a cohesive and functional living space that aligns with the user's industrial theme preferences.
