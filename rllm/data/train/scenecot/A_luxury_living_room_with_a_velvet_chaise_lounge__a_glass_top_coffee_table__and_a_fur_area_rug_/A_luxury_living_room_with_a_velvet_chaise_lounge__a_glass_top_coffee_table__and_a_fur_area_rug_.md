## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a luxury living room that includes a velvet chaise lounge, a glass top coffee table, and a fur area rug. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user's preferences emphasize a luxurious ambiance, with the chaise lounge serving as a comfortable seating area, the coffee table as a central focal point, and the rug providing warmth and texture. Additional elements such as a side table, floor lamp, wall art, and decorative plant are suggested to complete the room's aesthetic and functional goals.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to accommodate the user's requirements. The South Wall Area is designated for the chaise lounge, providing a comfortable seating zone. The Middle of the Room serves as the central area for the coffee table and rug, creating a focal point. The North Wall is reserved for wall art, enhancing the room's visual appeal. The South Wall also accommodates additional elements like the side table and floor lamp to support functionality and ambiance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the South Wall Area, a luxury velvet chaise lounge (2.0m x 0.9m x 0.8m) is recommended for seating. The Middle of the Room features a modern glass top coffee table (1.2m x 0.8m x 0.45m) and a luxury fur area rug (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.02m) to enhance warmth and texture. A modern wooden side table (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.6m) and a metal floor lamp (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.5m) are suggested for the South Wall to hold decorative items and provide ambient lighting. The North Wall is adorned with contemporary wall art (1.2m x 0.05m x 0.8m) for aesthetic enhancement. A luxury velvet cushion (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.15m) is recommended for additional comfort on the chaise lounge.

## 4. Scene Graph
The velvet chaise lounge is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to serve as a comfortable seating area. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.9m x 0.8m) fit well against the wall, ensuring no spatial conflicts and aligning with the luxury theme. This placement allows for ample space around the chaise lounge for movement and additional furniture, maintaining balance and proportion.

The glass top coffee table is centrally placed in the middle of the room, adjacent to the chaise lounge. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.8m x 0.45m) ensure it serves as a focal point without spatial conflicts. The central placement supports the room's aesthetic and functionality, enhancing the luxury feel.

The fur area rug is positioned under the coffee table, in front of the chaise lounge. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.02m) complement the existing seating arrangement, providing warmth and texture without disrupting the room's flow. This placement maintains balance and proportion, anchoring the seating area.

The side table is placed on the floor, adjacent to the south wall, to the right of the chaise lounge. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.6m) fit well without disrupting the layout, serving its purpose of holding decorative items while maintaining spatial balance and adhering to the luxury theme.

The floor lamp is placed on the floor, to the left of the chaise lounge, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.5m) ensure it provides ambient lighting without obstructing movement. This placement enhances the luxury feel and maintains a balanced layout.

The wall art is placed on the north wall, directly enhancing the room's visual appeal. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.05m x 0.8m) ensure it becomes a focal point, complementing the luxury theme without spatial conflicts.

The cushion is placed on the chaise lounge, providing additional comfort and aligning with the luxury theme. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.15m) enhance the seating area's aesthetic appeal without causing spatial conflicts.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified regarding the placement of the decorative plant, as the width of the floor lamp was too small to accommodate the plant to its left. Additionally, the south wall was too small to accommodate all intended objects. To resolve these conflicts, the decorative plant was removed, as it was deemed less critical to the user's preference for a luxury living room centered around the chaise lounge, coffee table, and area rug. This resolution ensured the room maintained its luxury aesthetic and functional goals without spatial conflicts.
