## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a bright and functional craft room that balances aesthetics with practicality. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a long wooden crafting table, colorful organizers, and a comfortable stool, all contributing to a harmonious and uncluttered environment. The user also desires additional items such as a task lamp for focused lighting, a bulletin board for inspiration, and a small plant to add a touch of nature. The room should facilitate crafting activities, provide ample storage, and maintain an open area for movement, ensuring a bright and energetic ambiance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures. The Crafting Workspace centers around the long wooden table, serving as the primary area for crafting activities. The Storage Area is designated for colorful organizers and a shelf to store crafting materials. The Seating Area includes a comfortable stool for ergonomic seating during crafting sessions. The Lighting Area focuses on providing adequate illumination with a task lamp. Additionally, the Inspiration Area features a bulletin board for creative ideas, and the Decorative Area includes a small plant to enhance the room's aesthetic.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Crafting Workspace, a modern wooden table measuring 2.5 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended. The Storage Area includes eclectic-style plastic organizers (1.5 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.5 meters) and a modern wooden shelf (1.2 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.8 meters) for storing supplies. The Seating Area features a modern metal stool (0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.6 meters) in white. The Lighting Area is enhanced by a modern metal task lamp (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.6 meters) in black. The Inspiration Area includes a modern cork bulletin board (1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 1.0 meter), and the Decorative Area features a minimalist ceramic plant (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.5 meters) in green.

## 4. Scene Graph
The crafting table is the central piece of the room, placed against the south wall and facing the north wall. This placement ensures optimal lighting from the north wall, typically where windows are located, providing even natural light essential for crafting. The table's dimensions (2.5m x 0.9m x 0.75m) allow it to fit comfortably along the wall, leaving ample space for movement and additional furniture.

The stool is positioned directly in front of the crafting table, facing the north wall. This placement ensures functional seating for crafting activities, aligning with the room's layout and maintaining a bright and open aesthetic. The stool's dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.6m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing movement.

The organizers are placed against the west wall, facing the east wall. This location provides stability and easy access to crafting materials, enhancing the room's functionality and maintaining a balanced spatial layout. The organizers' dimensions (1.5m x 0.3m x 1.5m) ensure they fit well against the wall without interfering with other elements.

The task lamp is placed on the crafting table, facing the north wall. Its small size (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.6m) ensures it does not obstruct the table's surface, providing focused lighting for crafting tasks and enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal.

The bulletin board is mounted on the south wall above the crafting table, facing the north wall. This placement ensures it is visible and accessible, serving as an inspirational element without conflicting with other objects. The bulletin board's dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably above the table.

The plant is placed on top of the organizers on the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement adds a touch of nature to the room, enhancing its aesthetic appeal without interfering with the functional areas. The plant's dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.5m) ensure it fits well on the organizers.

The shelf is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.3m x 1.8m) allow it to fit comfortably, providing additional storage without encroaching on other objects' space. This placement maintains the room's balance and enhances its functionality.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were positioned to ensure optimal functionality and aesthetic appeal, adhering to the user's vision of a bright and organized craft room. The spatial layout maintains balance and proportion, with each object complementing the overall design without causing overcrowding or obstruction.
