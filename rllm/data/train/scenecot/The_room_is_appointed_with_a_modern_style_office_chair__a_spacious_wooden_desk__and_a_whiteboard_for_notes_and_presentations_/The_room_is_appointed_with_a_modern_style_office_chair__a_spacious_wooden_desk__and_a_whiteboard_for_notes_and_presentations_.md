## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern office space characterized by a minimalist aesthetic and a cohesive color palette. Essential elements include a wooden desk, an ergonomic office chair, and a whiteboard for presentations. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for the desired setup. The focus is on functionality, with a preference for modern design elements that enhance the workspace's efficiency and visual appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures: the Whiteboard Wall for presentations, the Desk Area for work activities, the Seating Area for comfort, and the Lighting Provision for adequate illumination. Each substructure is designed to fulfill specific functional and aesthetic goals, ensuring a cohesive and efficient office environment.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Whiteboard Wall, a modern glass whiteboard is recommended to facilitate presentations. The Desk Area features a spacious wooden desk complemented by a desk organizer to maintain a clutter-free workspace. The Seating Area includes a modern ergonomic office chair and a footrest to enhance comfort during long work hours. The Lighting Provision consists of a modern desk lamp for focused lighting and a ceiling light for overall room illumination. Additionally, a minimalist plant is suggested to add a touch of nature and improve air quality, aligning with the modern aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The whiteboard is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall, to ensure visibility from the desk area. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.05m x 1.0m) fit well within the wall space, and its placement aligns with the user's preference for a modern office setting, maximizing functionality for writing and presenting.

The wooden desk, measuring 1.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.75 meters, is positioned against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement allows the user to view the whiteboard while working, maintaining a clear line of sight and ensuring no spatial conflicts with the whiteboard.

The desk organizer, with dimensions of 0.162 meters by 0.127 meters by 0.225 meters, is placed on the desk, facing the north wall. This ensures easy access for organizing office supplies, complementing the modern style and maintaining a neat workspace.

The office chair, measuring 0.7 meters by 0.7 meters by 1.2 meters, is placed in front of the desk, facing the south wall. This positioning allows for comfortable seating and effective use of the desk, adhering to modern design principles and user preferences.

The ergonomic footrest, sized at 0.4 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.15 meters, is placed under the desk to provide support for the user seated on the office chair. This placement maintains the room's clean, modern look while enhancing comfort.

The desk lamp, with dimensions of 0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters, is placed on the desk towards the left side, facing the north wall. This ensures it provides effective lighting without obstructing the workspace, aligning with the modern aesthetic.

The ceiling light, measuring 0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.15 meters, is centrally placed on the ceiling to provide balanced illumination throughout the room. This placement complements the modern style and ensures functionality in an office setting.

The plant, with dimensions of 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.6 meters, is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This positioning adds a decorative element without interfering with the desk or chair, enhancing the room's modern aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The arrangement of objects respects the room's dimensions and user preferences, ensuring a functional and aesthetically pleasing office environment.
