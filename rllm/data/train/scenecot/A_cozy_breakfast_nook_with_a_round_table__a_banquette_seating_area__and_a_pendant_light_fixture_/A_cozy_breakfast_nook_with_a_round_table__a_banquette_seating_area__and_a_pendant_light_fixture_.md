## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user has expressed a desire for a cozy breakfast nook within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary elements requested include a round dining table, banquette seating, and a pendant light fixture. The user emphasizes a cozy and inviting atmosphere, efficient use of space, and adequate lighting for dining activities. Additional considerations include cushions for comfort, a rug to define the space, and a side table for added functionality, all aligning with a modern aesthetic.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The central area is designated for the round dining table, serving as the focal point of the breakfast nook. The south wall is allocated for the banquette seating, providing a comfortable and ergonomic seating solution. The ceiling above the table is reserved for the pendant light fixture to ensure adequate lighting. Additional elements include a rug under the table to define the dining area and a side table adjacent to the banquette for added functionality.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central dining area, a modern-style round table with a diameter of 1.2 meters is recommended to facilitate comfortable seating. The banquette seating, measuring 3.0 meters in length, is suggested for the south wall to complement the table's location. A contemporary brass pendant light fixture is proposed to hang above the table, enhancing the cozy ambiance. To complete the nook, modern fabric cushions in blue are recommended for the banquette seating, a beige rug measuring 2.0 meters by 2.0 meters is suggested to define the space, and a modern wood side table is advised for holding items near the seating area.

## 4. Scene Graph
The round table is centrally placed in the room to create a focal point for the breakfast nook. Its dimensions (1.2m diameter, 0.75m height) allow for comfortable seating without overwhelming the space. Positioned in the middle of the room, the table ensures equal access from all sides, aligning with the user's preference for a cozy and functional dining area. This central placement adheres to design principles of balance and accessibility, enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal.

The banquette seating is strategically placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to complement the round table's central location. Measuring 3.0 meters in length, 0.7 meters in width, and 0.9 meters in height, it fits well along the wall, providing a comfortable backing and intimate dining experience. This placement leaves ample space for movement around the table and seating area, maintaining balance and proportion within the room.

The pendant light fixture is suspended from the ceiling directly above the round table, providing focused illumination for the dining area. With dimensions of 0.161 meters in length and width and 0.776 meters in height, it enhances the cozy ambiance and maintains aesthetic harmony with the room's modern style.

A cushion is placed on the banquette seating to enhance comfort, aligning with the user's vision of a cozy nook. The cushion's dimensions (0.633m length, 0.21m width, 0.338m height) ensure it fits comfortably on the seating without interfering with other objects. This placement enhances the seating's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The rug is placed under the round table, centered in the room, to define the dining area. Measuring 2.0 meters by 2.0 meters, it comfortably fits under the table and extends slightly beyond it, creating a cozy and defined space around the table. This placement adheres to design principles of proportion and balance, providing a visual anchor for the seating area.

The side table is placed adjacent to the banquette seating on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.627m length, 0.621m width, 0.836m height) ensure it does not obstruct movement around the table, maintaining functionality and comfort. This placement enhances the room's cozy and functional breakfast nook atmosphere, aligning with the user's preferences.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, a conflict was identified with the cushions on the banquette seating. The area of the banquette seating was too small to accommodate both cushions, leading to a decision to delete one of them. Cushion_2 was removed based on its lower functional priority compared to the other elements, ensuring the room's functionality and the user's preference for a cozy breakfast nook with a round table, banquette seating, and a pendant light fixture are maintained.
