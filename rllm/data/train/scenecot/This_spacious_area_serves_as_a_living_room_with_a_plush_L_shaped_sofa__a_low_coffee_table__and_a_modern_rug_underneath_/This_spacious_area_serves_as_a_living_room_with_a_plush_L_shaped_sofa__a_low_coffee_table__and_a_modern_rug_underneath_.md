## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a spacious and modern living room that emphasizes comfort and style. Key elements include a plush L-shaped sofa, a low coffee table, and a modern rug, with the sofa anchoring the south wall. The room should also feature an art display shelf on the west wall and maintain an open area for movement. Natural light from a window on the east wall enhances the inviting atmosphere. The room's dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for these elements to harmonize aesthetically and functionally.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures: the Seating Area, centered around the L-shaped sofa on the south wall; the Coffee Table Zone, directly in front of the sofa; the Rug Area, which defines the seating zone; the Art Display Area on the east wall; and the Open Movement Space, ensuring the room remains uncluttered. Each substructure serves a specific purpose, from providing comfortable seating to showcasing art and maintaining a spacious feel.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a modern L-shaped sofa in grey fabric is recommended, providing ample seating and anchoring the room's design. The Coffee Table Zone features a modern glass coffee table, offering a surface for drinks and decor. A beige wool rug is suggested for the Rug Area, adding texture and warmth. The Art Display Area includes a minimalist white wood art shelf for showcasing art pieces. Additional recommendations include a contemporary metal floor lamp for ambient lighting, a decorative blue ceramic vase for the coffee table, and a modern white wood storage bench for extra seating and storage along the west wall.

## 4. Scene Graph
The L-shaped sofa is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to provide stability and maximize seating space. Its dimensions are 3.211 meters in length, 1.018 meters in width, and 0.784 meters in height. This placement allows ample space in the center for the coffee table and rug, aligning with the user's preference for a spacious layout. The coffee table, measuring 1.31 meters by 0.787 meters by 0.409 meters, is positioned in front of the sofa, maintaining functionality and aesthetic appeal. It is centrally located, ensuring balance and proportion within the room's layout.

The rug, sized at 2.5 meters by 2.0 meters, is placed under the coffee table, extending beyond it to define the seating area. This placement adheres to design principles by adding texture and warmth without obstructing movement paths. The art shelf, with dimensions of 1.5 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.8 meters, is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This ensures visibility and accessibility for displaying art, enhancing the room's aesthetic without interfering with the existing furniture layout.

The floor lamp, standing 1.8 meters tall, is placed on the south wall in the southeast corner, adjacent to the sofa. It faces the north wall, providing functional lighting for the sofa area while maintaining an open and airy feel. The decorative vase, measuring 0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.4 meters, is placed on the coffee table, serving as a focal point of decoration without obstructing other objects. Finally, the storage bench, measuring 1.18 meters by 0.495 meters by 0.7 meters, is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement enhances functionality and aesthetic appeal without disrupting the room's flow.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the south wall being too small to accommodate all intended objects, including the side table, coffee table, sofa, and floor lamp. To resolve this, the side table was removed, as it was deemed the least important for the user's preference and the room's functionality. This adjustment ensures the room maintains its spacious and modern aesthetic while accommodating the essential elements.
