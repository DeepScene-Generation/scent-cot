## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a modern breakfast corner within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters. The focal point of this space is a metal high table, complemented by high chairs and a ceramic milk bottle, all adhering to a minimalist aesthetic. The user emphasizes the need for ergonomic and stable seating, with a set of four high chairs to accommodate multiple users. Additional elements such as a small rug, a wall clock, a plant, and pendant lighting are suggested to enhance the functionality and aesthetics of the breakfast corner, while ensuring the total number of objects does not exceed twelve.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The primary substructure is the Breakfast Area, centered around the high table and chairs, serving as the main functional zone. The Decorative Area includes the ceramic milk bottle and plant, adding aesthetic value. The Lighting Area is defined by the pendant light, providing ambient illumination. The Timekeeping Area is marked by the wall clock, ensuring practicality. Lastly, the Rug Area defines the spatial boundary of the breakfast corner, adding warmth and cohesion.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Breakfast Area, a modern metal high table (1.2m x 0.6m x 1.0m) is recommended, accompanied by four high chairs (each 0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) to ensure ergonomic seating. The Decorative Area features a ceramic milk bottle (0.1m x 0.1m x 0.3m) and a plant in a ceramic pot (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m), both enhancing the minimalist theme. The Lighting Area includes a modern pendant light (0.2m x 0.2m x 1.0m) to illuminate the breakfast corner. The Timekeeping Area is defined by a modern metal wall clock (0.3m x 0.05m x 0.3m), while the Rug Area features a grey fabric rug (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.01m) to anchor the space.

## 4. Scene Graph
The high table is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, serving as the centerpiece of the breakfast corner. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.6m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, maintaining openness in the room. This placement aligns with the user's preference for a modern breakfast nook, providing a focal point and framing the breakfast area.

High chair 1 is positioned to the right of the high table, facing the east wall. This placement ensures easy access to the table and maintains the modern aesthetic of the breakfast corner. High chair 2 is placed to the left of the high table, also facing the east wall, complementing the existing chair on the right and maintaining balance and symmetry. High chair 3 is positioned in front of the high table, facing the east wall, completing the seating arrangement and ensuring functionality for breakfast routines. High chair 4, initially placed behind the high table, was repositioned to face the high table on the east wall, maintaining the set's symmetry and functionality.

The ceramic milk bottle is placed on the high table, adding a decorative and functional element to the breakfast corner. Its small size (0.1m x 0.1m x 0.3m) ensures it fits comfortably without cluttering the table. The rug is placed in the middle of the room, underneath the high table and chairs, aligning with the east wall setup. Its grey color complements the modern style, visually anchoring the breakfast corner while maintaining a clear and functional space.

The wall clock is mounted on the north wall, ensuring visibility to everyone seated at the high table. This placement maintains the room's modern aesthetic while providing a functional timekeeping element. The plant is placed on the north wall, adjacent to the wall clock, enhancing the visual appeal and maintaining the modern theme. It faces the south wall, maintaining consistent orientation with the room's design. The pendant light is installed on the ceiling, centered above the high table and chairs, providing direct lighting to the breakfast corner. This position ensures it is visually appealing and functionally effective, without interfering with any other elements in the room.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the initial placement of high chair 4 behind the high table, as it would have been out of bounds. To resolve this, high chair 4 was repositioned to face the high table on the east wall, ensuring it remains part of the cohesive seating arrangement. This adjustment maintains the room's balance and symmetry, fulfilling the user's vision for a modern breakfast corner without exceeding spatial boundaries.
