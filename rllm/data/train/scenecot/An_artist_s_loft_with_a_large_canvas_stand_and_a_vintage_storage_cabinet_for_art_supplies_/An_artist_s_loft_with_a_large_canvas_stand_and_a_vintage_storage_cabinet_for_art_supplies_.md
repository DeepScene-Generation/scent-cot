## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions an artist's loft with a focus on functionality and aesthetic appeal, suitable for painting and art supply storage. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a high ceiling of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for creative activities. Key elements include a large canvas stand, a vintage storage cabinet, and optimal lighting to support artistic endeavors. The user prefers a blend of industrial and vintage styles, emphasizing an open and accessible workspace conducive to creativity.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures: the Canvas Stand Area, Storage Cabinet Area, Central Workspace, and Ceiling Structure. The Canvas Stand Area is dedicated to painting, requiring good lighting and accessibility. The Storage Cabinet Area focuses on storing art supplies, with additional shelving to enhance functionality. The Central Workspace is designed for mixing colors and sketching, featuring a large table and comfortable seating. The Ceiling Structure is considered for lighting fixtures to enhance the room's ambiance without obstructing the open feel.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Canvas Stand Area, an industrial-style canvas stand and a modern floor lamp are recommended to provide optimal lighting for painting. The Storage Cabinet Area includes a vintage storage cabinet and a matching wooden shelf to store art supplies efficiently. The Central Workspace features a rustic wooden table and an industrial-style chair, providing a sturdy and comfortable environment for artistic activities. An easel is also suggested to complement the painting area. A rolling cart offers additional storage, while a bohemian-style rug adds warmth and visual interest to the central workspace.

## 4. Scene Graph
The canvas stand, measuring 1.2m x 0.6m x 2.0m, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement maximizes space efficiency and ensures the stand is well-lit by natural light from the room's entrance. The floor lamp, with dimensions of 0.5m x 0.5m x 1.8m, is positioned to the right of the canvas stand, also on the north wall, to provide additional lighting for the painting area. The vintage storage cabinet, measuring 1.0m x 0.5m x 1.5m, is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, ensuring easy access to art supplies without obstructing the room's flow. Adjacent to the cabinet, the vintage-style shelf (0.8m x 0.3m x 1.2m) is also placed on the south wall, creating a cohesive storage area. The rustic table, measuring 2.0m x 1.0m x 0.75m, is centrally located in the room, facing the north wall, serving as a focal point for mixing and sketching. The industrial-style chair, with dimensions of 0.557m x 0.617m x 0.931m, is placed behind the table, facing the south wall, providing comfortable seating for the artist. The classic-style easel, measuring 0.8m x 0.6m x 1.8m, is placed to the left of the canvas stand on the north wall, maintaining an organized painting area. The rolling cart, measuring 0.5m x 0.3m x 0.8m, is positioned on the east side of the table, facing the west wall, ensuring easy access to supplies while avoiding clutter. Finally, the bohemian-style rug, measuring 2.5m x 2.5m, is placed under the table and chair in the middle of the room, enhancing the workspace's aesthetic without hindering functionality.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The layout effectively balances functionality and aesthetics, ensuring all objects are accessible and complement the artist's loft theme. The arrangement maintains an open and inviting space, conducive to creativity and artistic expression.

        - calculation:
            - Rotation of rug_1: 0.0°
            - Rotation of table_1: 0.0°
            - Rotation difference: |0.0 - 0.0| = 0.0°
        - conclusion: Using length dimension for directional constraint
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'under' relation
        - calculation:
            - rug_1 size: 2.5 (length)
            - Cluster size (under): 0.0 (non-directional)
        - conclusion: No directional constraint applied
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'middle of the room' constraint
        - calculation:
            - rug_1 size: length=2.5, width=2.5, height=0.01
            - x_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 2.5/2 = 1.25
            - x_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 2.5/2 = 3.75
            - y_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 2.5/2 = 1.25
            - y_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 2.5/2 = 3.75
            - z_min = z_max = 0.005
        - conclusion: Possible position: (1.25, 3.75, 1.25, 3.75, 0.005, 0.005)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(1.25-3.75), y(1.25-3.75)
            - Final coordinates: x=1.8089, y=1.7173, z=0.005
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 1.8089, y: 1.7173, z: 0.005
    5. reason: Collision check with table_1
        - calculation:
            - No overlap detected with table_1
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Final coordinates: x=1.8089, y=1.7173, z=0.005
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 1.8089, y: 1.7173, z: 0.005
