## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a classic study room characterized by elegance, functionality, and comfort. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a writing desk, a leather chair, and a globe on a side table, all reflecting a classic aesthetic. Additional preferences include a bookshelf, a rug, and a wall clock to enhance the room's classic style and functionality. The focus is on creating a space that is both visually appealing and practical for reading and writing activities.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures: the Writing Desk Area, Leather Chair Area, and Side Table with Globe. The Writing Desk Area is designed for reading and writing, requiring a classic desk and adequate lighting. The Leather Chair Area focuses on comfort, featuring a leather chair and an ottoman. The Side Table with Globe serves as a decorative and functional space, hosting the globe and enhancing the room's aesthetic. Additional areas include a Bookshelf Area for storage and a central Rug Area to add warmth and texture.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Writing Desk Area, a classic mahogany writing desk (1.5m x 0.8m x 0.75m) and a brass desk lamp (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.5m) are recommended to provide a functional and elegant workspace. The Leather Chair Area features a brown leather chair (0.7m x 0.7m x 1.0m) and a matching ottoman (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.4m) for added comfort. The Side Table with Globe includes a dark walnut side table (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.6m) and an antique-style globe (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.4m). A mahogany bookshelf (1.0m x 0.3m x 2.0m) is suggested for the Bookshelf Area, while a classic red rug (2.5m x 2.5m) and a gold metal wall clock (0.056m x 0.085m x 0.33m) enhance the room's classic ambiance.

## 4. Scene Graph
The writing desk, a central piece in the classic study, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures optimal lighting and a view of the entire room, aligning with the user's preference for a classic aesthetic. The desk's dimensions (1.5m x 0.8m x 0.75m) fit comfortably along the south wall, maintaining balance and proportion.

The desk lamp, complementing the writing desk, is placed on it, facing the north wall. This ensures it provides adequate lighting for reading and writing without obstructing the workspace. The lamp's classic style and dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.5m) align with the room's aesthetic and functional needs.

The leather chair is positioned in front of the writing desk, facing south. This setup ensures easy access and usability, with the chair's dimensions (0.7m x 0.7m x 1.0m) fitting comfortably without obstructing movement. The chair's brown leather complements the mahogany desk, enhancing the room's classic appeal.

Initially, the ottoman was placed in front of the leather chair, but due to spatial conflicts with the writing desk, it was repositioned to the left of the chair. This placement maintains functionality as a leg rest while ensuring no obstruction in the room. The ottoman's dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.4m) fit well within the available space.

The side table is placed to the right of the writing desk, facing the north wall. This positioning ensures easy access to the globe and maintains a balanced look with the chair on one side and the side table on the other. The side table's dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.6m) accommodate the globe comfortably.

The globe is placed on the side table, facing the north wall, ensuring alignment with the room's design aesthetics. The globe's dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.4m) fit well on the side table, contributing to the classic study theme.

The bookshelf is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. This location provides ample vertical space for book storage without disrupting the existing layout. The bookshelf's dimensions (1.0m x 0.3m x 2.0m) complement the room's classic style and functionality.

The rug is centrally placed in the room, covering the floor and enhancing the seating area's comfort and visual appeal. Its dimensions (2.5m x 2.5m) allow it to fit under the leather chair and ottoman, aligning with the room's classic aesthetic.

The wall clock is mounted on the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures visibility from the desk area, allowing the user to easily check the time while working. The clock's classic metal and gold finish harmonize with the room's decor, maintaining a balanced and aesthetically pleasing layout.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose when the ottoman was initially placed in front of the leather chair, as it obstructed the writing desk. To resolve this, the ottoman was repositioned to the left of the leather chair, ensuring it remains functional as a leg rest without causing any obstruction. This adjustment maintains the room's classic aesthetic and functional layout.
