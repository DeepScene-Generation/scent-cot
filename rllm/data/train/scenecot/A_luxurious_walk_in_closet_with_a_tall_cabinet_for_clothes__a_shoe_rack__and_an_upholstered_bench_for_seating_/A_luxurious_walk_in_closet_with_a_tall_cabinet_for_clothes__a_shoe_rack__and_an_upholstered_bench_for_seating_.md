## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a luxurious walk-in closet with specific elements to enhance both functionality and aesthetics. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for the desired features. Key components include a tall cabinet for clothing storage, a shoe rack, and an upholstered bench for seating. Additional elements such as a full-length mirror, a side table for accessories, and lighting fixtures like a chandelier and a floor lamp are suggested to enhance the room's luxurious ambiance and functionality.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to accommodate the user's requirements. The Clothing Storage Area is designated along the south wall for the tall cabinet, ensuring easy access and organization. The Shoe Display Area is positioned along the east wall for the shoe rack, providing visibility and accessibility. The Central Seating Area is in the middle of the room, featuring the upholstered bench for dressing convenience. The Mirror Area on the west wall allows for outfit checking, while the Lighting Area includes a chandelier on the ceiling for ambient lighting. A side table is proposed near the bench for accessory storage.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Clothing Storage Area, a luxurious wooden tall cabinet with dimensions of 1.8 meters by 0.6 meters by 2.5 meters is recommended. The Shoe Display Area features a modern metal shoe rack measuring 1.1 meters by 0.282 meters by 1.101 meters. The Central Seating Area includes a luxurious upholstered bench with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.45 meters. A classic full-length mirror with a silver frame, measuring 0.8 meters by 0.05 meters by 2.0 meters, is suggested for the Mirror Area. The Lighting Area is enhanced by a crystal chandelier with dimensions of 0.494 meters by 0.494 meters by 0.5 meters. A small side table, measuring 0.627 meters by 0.621 meters by 0.836 meters, is recommended for accessory storage near the bench.

## 4. Scene Graph
The tall cabinet is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to serve as a central feature in the luxurious walk-in closet. Its dimensions (1.8m x 0.6m x 2.5m) allow it to fit comfortably along the wall, ensuring stability and ease of access. This placement avoids blocking natural light and leaves ample space for other elements, aligning with the user's vision of a luxurious closet.

The shoe rack is positioned on the east wall, facing the west wall, complementing the tall cabinet without causing spatial congestion. Its dimensions (1.1m x 0.282m x 1.101m) ensure it maintains clear pathways and does not obstruct access to the cabinet. This placement provides a balanced visual alignment and convenient shoe storage.

The upholstered bench is centrally placed in the room, facing the north wall, to provide a convenient seating option for dressing. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.5m x 0.45m) ensure it does not obstruct pathways, maintaining accessibility and complementing the luxurious theme.

The full-length mirror is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, to provide optimal viewing angles for outfit checking. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.05m x 2.0m) ensure it does not block access to other objects, maintaining a balanced layout and enhancing the room's luxurious feel.

The chandelier is centrally placed on the ceiling to provide ambient lighting. Its dimensions (0.494m x 0.494m x 0.5m) ensure it does not obstruct movement, enhancing the luxurious ambiance and serving as a focal point in the room.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose regarding the placement of the side table and floor lamp near the upholstered bench, as the bench's width was insufficient to accommodate both objects. To resolve this, the floor lamp was removed, prioritizing the side table's functionality for accessory storage. This decision aligns with the user's preference for a luxurious walk-in closet with essential elements like the tall cabinet, shoe rack, and upholstered bench. The removal of the floor lamp ensures the room maintains its aesthetic and functional balance without overcrowding.
