## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a multipurpose craft room that accommodates crafting activities, storage, and comfort. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, offering ample space for various functions. Key requirements include a large table for crafting, a comfortable chair for seating, and cubbies for organized storage. Additional elements such as a task lamp for focused lighting, a rug for comfort, and a bulletin board for inspiration are recommended to enhance both functionality and aesthetics.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main substructures: a central workspace, a storage area, and a seating area. The central workspace is designed to house the large table and task lamp, providing a dedicated area for crafting activities. The storage area includes cubbies and a shelf to organize materials and tools efficiently. The seating area features a comfortable chair and a side table, ensuring a relaxing environment for prolonged crafting sessions. Natural lighting is also considered to enhance the room's ambiance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central workspace, a modern-style wooden table measuring 2.0 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.75 meters is recommended, along with a metal task lamp for focused lighting. The storage area includes contemporary wooden cubbies (2.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.8 meters) and an industrial-style metal and wood shelf (1.5 meters by 0.3 meters by 2.0 meters) for additional storage. The seating area features an ergonomic chair (0.686 meters by 0.681 meters by 1.043 meters) and a modern wooden side table (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters). A bohemian-style rug (3.0 meters by 2.0 meters) and a minimalist cork bulletin board (1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 1.0 meter) are included to enhance comfort and organization.

## 4. Scene Graph
The table is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall, to serve as the focal point for crafting activities. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.75m) allow for easy access from all sides, maximizing workspace accessibility and movement. This central placement aligns with the user's preference for a multipurpose space and adheres to design principles of balance and symmetry.

The chair is positioned in front of the table, facing the south wall, ensuring ergonomic use during crafting activities. Its dimensions (0.686m x 0.681m x 1.043m) allow it to fit comfortably without overlapping the table, maintaining balance and proportion in the room layout. This placement ensures functionality and aesthetic appeal, complementing the modern style of the table.

The cubbies are placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, to maximize floor space and maintain accessibility. With dimensions of 2.5m x 0.4m x 1.8m, they provide ample storage without obstructing movement or access to the table or chair. This placement enhances functionality and adheres to design principles of balance and proportion.

The task lamp is placed on the table, providing focused lighting for the crafting workspace. Its small size (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) ensures it does not interfere with other furniture or obstruct movement. This placement aligns with the user's desire for a craft room, offering necessary lighting for detailed work.

The rug is placed under the table and chair in the middle of the room, adding comfort and aesthetic value to the crafting area. Its dimensions (3.0m x 2.0m x 0.02m) allow it to complement the existing furniture arrangement without causing spatial conflicts, aligning with the room's multipurpose function.

The side table is placed to the right of the chair, facing the north wall, providing functional accessibility for the user. Its small footprint (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.5m) ensures it fits well next to the chair without obstructing movement or interfering with the task lamp's lighting.

The bulletin board is mounted on the north wall above the cubbies, facing the south wall, allowing for easy visibility from the crafting area. Its placement utilizes vertical space effectively, enhancing the room's organizational capabilities without cluttering the space.

The shelf is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, providing additional storage while maintaining an open and organized space. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.3m x 2.0m) ensure it stands alone for optimal access and use, complementing the room's storage capacity.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were strategically positioned to avoid spatial conflicts and maintain the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal. The arrangement ensures a balanced and proportionate layout, adhering to the user's preferences and design principles.

        - calculation:
            - shelf_1 size: 1.5x0.3x2.0
            - Cluster size (south_wall): 0.0 (non-directional)
        - conclusion: No directional constraint applied
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'south_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - x_min = 2.5 + -1 * 5.0/2 + 1 * 1.5/2 = 0.75
            - x_max = 2.5 + 1 * 5.0/2 + -1 * 1.5/2 = 4.25
            - y_min = 0 + 1 * 0.0/2 + 1 * 0.3/2 = 0.15
            - y_max = 0 + 1 * 0.0/2 + 1 * 0.3/2 = 0.15
            - z_min = z_max = 2.0/2 = 1.0
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.75, 4.25, 0.15, 0.15, 1.0, 1.0)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.75-4.25), y(0.15-0.15)
            - Final coordinates: x=3.198048501416409, y=0.15, z=1.0
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 3.198048501416409, y: 0.15, z: 1.0
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=3.198048501416409, y=0.15, z=1.0
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 3.198048501416409, y: 0.15, z: 1.0
