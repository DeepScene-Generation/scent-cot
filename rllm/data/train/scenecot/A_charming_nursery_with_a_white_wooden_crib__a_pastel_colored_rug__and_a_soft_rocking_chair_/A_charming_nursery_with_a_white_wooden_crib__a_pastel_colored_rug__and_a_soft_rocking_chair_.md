## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user's primary goal is to create a charming nursery designed for a baby, emphasizing rest, play, and parental care. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The nursery should include a crib area, a play area with a rug, a rocking chair area, and spaces for easy access and lighting. The user prefers a soft pastel color palette to maintain an inviting and cohesive atmosphere, with a focus on essential items that do not exceed nine in total.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The nursery is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Crib Area is the focal point for rest and sleep, featuring a white wooden crib. The Rocking Chair Area is intended for parental care, providing comfortable seating and a small side table for essentials. The Play Area, marked by a pastel-colored rug, is crucial for safe crawling and includes storage baskets or a toy box for organization. Additionally, the room requires easy access to the crib and proper lighting, with a nightlight or lamp ensuring functionality at night.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Crib Area, a classic white wooden crib is recommended, complemented by a whimsical crib mobile for visual engagement. The Rocking Chair Area includes a soft rocking chair and a small side table, both in classic style and white color, to match the nursery's theme. The Play Area features a pastel-colored rug and a classic white toy box for storage. A nightlight is suggested to provide subtle illumination, enhancing the nursery's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 4. Scene Graph
The white wooden crib, a central element of the nursery, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures stability and provides an open view for the parent entering the room. The crib's dimensions are 1.4 meters in length, 0.8 meters in width, and 1.0 meter in height. The crib mobile, designed for visual engagement, is suspended centrally above the crib from the ceiling, ensuring it does not interfere with other objects. Its dimensions are 0.4 meters in length, 0.4 meters in width, and 0.6 meters in height.

The pastel-colored rug, measuring 2.0 meters by 2.0 meters with a height of 0.02 meters, is placed in the middle of the room. This central location creates a designated play area without obstructing access to other elements. The toy box, with dimensions of 0.7 meters in length, 0.5 meters in width, and 0.5 meters in height, is placed on the south side of the rug, ensuring easy access for play and storage. It is oriented with its length parallel to the rug, facing the north wall.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified regarding the placement of the rocking chair, side table, and nightlight due to spatial constraints. The width of the crib was too small to accommodate the rocking chair to its right, leading to a layout conflict. To resolve this, the rocking chair, side table, and nightlight were removed, prioritizing the essential elements of the nursery, such as the crib, rug, and toy box, to maintain functionality and aesthetic appeal.
