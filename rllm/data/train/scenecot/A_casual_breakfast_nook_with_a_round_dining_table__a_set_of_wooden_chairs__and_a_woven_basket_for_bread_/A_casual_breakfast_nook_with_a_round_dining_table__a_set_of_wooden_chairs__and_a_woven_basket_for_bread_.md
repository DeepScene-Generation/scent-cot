## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a casual breakfast nook centered around a round dining table, complemented by wooden chairs and a woven basket for bread. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters. The primary focus is on creating a cozy and inviting dining area with functional elements for displaying and storing breakfast essentials. The user prefers a welcoming atmosphere with a central dining area, open pathways for movement, and a tabletop display for bread, while avoiding any modifications related to windows or doors.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into a central dining area and peripheral storage and display zones. The central dining area is the focal point, featuring a round dining table and chairs for casual dining. The tabletop display area includes a woven basket for bread, enhancing the dining experience. A small shelf is designated for storing jams and spreads, providing convenient access to breakfast essentials. The space is further defined by a rug under the dining table, adding comfort and style while maintaining unobstructed pathways for movement.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central dining area, a casual-style round dining table with a diameter of 1.2 meters is recommended, accompanied by four wooden chairs, each measuring 0.5 meters by 0.495 meters by 0.779 meters. A woven basket, measuring 0.343 meters by 0.264 meters by 0.165 meters, is suggested for the tabletop display. A small wooden shelf, 0.6 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.4 meters, is recommended for storing jams and spreads. A decorative ceramic centerpiece, measuring 0.142 meters by 0.159 meters by 0.351 meters, adds aesthetic appeal to the table. A beige fabric rug, 2.0 meters by 2.0 meters, is proposed to define the dining space.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dining table, a light brown wooden piece, is placed centrally in the room, serving as the nucleus of the breakfast nook. Its central placement allows for easy access from all sides, aligning with the user's vision of a cozy dining area. The table's dimensions (1.2m x 1.2m x 0.75m) fit comfortably in the room's center, ensuring balance and optimal usage of surrounding space.

Chair_1, a dark brown wooden chair, is placed to the right of the dining table, facing the west wall. This placement ensures functionality for seating and maintains a balanced aesthetic within the room. Chair_2 is positioned to the left of the dining table, facing the east wall, creating symmetry and allowing easy access to the table. Chair_3 is placed in front of the dining table, facing the south wall, completing the seating arrangement and maintaining a sense of openness. Chair_4 is positioned behind the dining table, facing the north wall, ensuring balance and symmetry around the table.

The woven basket is placed on the dining table, serving as a decorative and functional element that enhances the breakfast nook's casual atmosphere. Its small size ensures it fits comfortably on the table without obstructing the seating arrangement. The shelf is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, ensuring easy access to stored items and maintaining room flow. The centerpiece is placed on the dining table, acting as a focal point and enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal. The rug is centered under the dining table and chairs, defining the dining area without obstructing movement or clashing with other elements.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The arrangement of objects ensures a balanced and functional layout, adhering to the user's preferences and design principles. The placement of each object maintains unobstructed pathways and enhances the room's cozy and inviting atmosphere.

- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with east_wall
        - calculation:
            - Rotation of shelf_1: 270.0°
            - Rotation of east_wall: 90.0°
            - Rotation difference: |270.0 - 90.0| = 180.0°
