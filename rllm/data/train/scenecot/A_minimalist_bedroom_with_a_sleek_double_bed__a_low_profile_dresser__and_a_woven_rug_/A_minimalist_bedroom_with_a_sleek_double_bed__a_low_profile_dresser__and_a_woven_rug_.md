## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a minimalist bedroom that emphasizes simplicity and functionality. The room is designed to accommodate a sleek double bed, a low-profile dresser, and a woven rug, all within a space measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user's preference for a minimalist aesthetic necessitates maintaining a clean, uncluttered appearance, ensuring open and airy space, and harmonizing textures and materials. Additional items such as a nightstand, table lamp, and chair are considered to enhance both functionality and aesthetic appeal, while adhering to the minimalist theme.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into specific areas based on the user's requirements. The North Wall Area is designated for the bed, serving as the focal point of the room. The South Wall Area is intended for the dresser, providing storage while maintaining balance with the bed. The Center Area is reserved for the rug, creating a cohesive look and functional walking surface. Additional areas include the space beside the bed for a nightstand and lamp, and a corner for a decorative plant, ensuring the room remains open and uncluttered.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the North Wall Area, a minimalist double bed with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.8 meters by 0.5 meters is recommended. The South Wall Area features a minimalist dresser measuring 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.8 meters, providing ample storage. The Center Area includes a woven rug (2.5 meters by 2.5 meters) to enhance aesthetic value and warmth. A minimalist nightstand (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters) and a sleek metal lamp (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.4 meters) are recommended for placement beside the bed. A decorative plant (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter) is suggested to add a touch of greenery, complementing the minimalist style.

## 4. Scene Graph
The double bed is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, as it serves as the focal point of the minimalist bedroom. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.8m x 0.5m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, ensuring unobstructed views and easy access from both sides. This placement aligns with the user's preference for a minimalist setup, using the wall to enhance simplicity and openness, while maintaining balance and proportion in the room.

The dresser is positioned on the south wall, facing the north wall, to complement the bed without creating spatial clutter. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.5m x 0.8m) ensure it fits well against the wall, providing convenient storage access without interfering with the bed's use or aesthetic. This placement maintains balance and proportion by aligning major furniture on opposite walls, supporting the minimalist design.

The rug is centrally placed in the room, enhancing visual harmony and functionality. Its dimensions (2.5m x 2.5m) allow it to span the space between the bed and dresser, creating a cohesive look and ensuring it serves as a functional walking surface. The rug's low profile ensures it does not obstruct any functional aspects of the bedroom, maintaining the minimalist aesthetic.

The nightstand is placed to the right of the bed, facing the south wall, providing functional storage adjacent to the sleeping area. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.5m) allow it to fit comfortably beside the bed without interfering with the dresser or rug. This placement aligns with the user's preference for a minimalist design, adhering to design principles of balance and proportion.

The lamp is placed on the nightstand to the right of the bed, facing the north wall. Its small size (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.4m) allows it to fit comfortably on the nightstand without overlapping other objects. This placement ensures accessibility and functionality, while maintaining the minimalist aesthetic desired by the user.

The plant is placed on the floor near the north wall, to the left of the bed, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) ensure it does not interfere with the bed's functionality. This placement adds a natural element without overwhelming the room, complementing the minimalist style and maintaining balance and functionality within the space.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the placement of the chair adjacent to the dresser on the south wall. The width of the dresser is too small to accommodate the chair beside it without creating spatial clutter. To resolve this, the chair was removed, as it was deemed less important for the user's preference and the room's functionality compared to the other elements. This decision aligns with the user's desire for a minimalist bedroom with a sleek double bed, low-profile dresser, and woven rug, ensuring the room remains open and uncluttered.
