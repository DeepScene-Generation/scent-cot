## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a bohemian-style bedroom characterized by natural materials, vibrant colors, and eclectic decor. Key elements include a natural wood bed frame, a multicolored rug, and a hanging macramé plant holder. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user's preferences emphasize a harmonious and functional living space that incorporates comfort, natural aesthetics, and flexibility for creative expression.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Natural Wood Bed Frame Area is designated for sleeping, focusing on comfort and natural aesthetics. The Hanging Plant Area is intended for decorative elements like the macramé plant holder and a lush plant. The Open Creative Space allows for movement and artistic expression, featuring a low table and floor cushions. The Multicolored Rug Area anchors the space, providing warmth and a pop of color, complemented by floor lamps and side tables for added functionality and style.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Natural Wood Bed Frame Area, a bohemian-style bed frame made of natural wood with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.6 meters by 0.5 meters is recommended. The Hanging Plant Area features a macramé plant holder and a fern plant, adding a natural touch. The Open Creative Space includes a low table (1.0 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.3 meters) and a multicolored floor cushion (0.7 meters by 0.7 meters by 0.15 meters) for seating. The Multicolored Rug Area features a wool rug (3.0 meters by 2.0 meters by 0.02 meters), a floor lamp (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.5 meters), and a woven basket (0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters) for storage. Wall art (1.0 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.0 meters) is recommended to enhance the bohemian vibe.

## 4. Scene Graph
The bed frame, a central element of the bohemian bedroom, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. Its natural wood material and bohemian style align with the user's aesthetic preferences. This placement maximizes space and maintains balance, allowing for easy access and leaving the rest of the room open for other elements. The bed linen, multicolored and made of cotton, is placed directly on the bed frame, maintaining functionality and design coherence. The macramé holder, a key decorative element, is hung from the ceiling towards the middle of the room, creating a focal point without disrupting the bed area. The fern plant, placed on the ceiling away from the macramé holder, adds vertical interest and complements the bohemian theme. The low table is centrally placed in the room, facing the north wall, serving as a focal point for artistic expression. The floor cushion, adjacent to the low table, provides seating and complements the room's aesthetic. The multicolored rug, placed beneath the low table and floor cushion, anchors the space and enhances the room's decor. The floor lamp, positioned at the edge of the rug, provides lighting for the seating area. The woven basket, placed to the left of the low table, offers storage while enhancing the bohemian charm. Finally, the wall art is placed above the bed on the south wall, creating a decorative focal point that complements the room's aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited space on the bed frame, which could not accommodate both the bed linen and the decorative pillow. To resolve this, the decorative pillow was removed, prioritizing the bed linen for its functional and aesthetic contribution to the bohemian theme. This adjustment ensures the room maintains its intended style and functionality without overcrowding the bed area.
