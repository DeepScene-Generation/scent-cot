## 1. Requirement Analysis
The nursery is envisioned as a peaceful and functional space catering to both the infant and the caregiver. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user's primary requirements include a crib, a rocking chair, and a rug, all arranged to ensure safety, comfort, and aesthetic appeal. The nursery should adhere to a serene color palette, with a focus on classic style elements. Additional functional needs include a changing table, storage solutions, and soft lighting to enhance the room's calming ambiance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The nursery is divided into several functional substructures. The Sleeping Area is designated along the south wall for the crib, ensuring stability and safety. The Caregiver's Comfort Zone is near the east wall, where the rocking chair is placed for interaction with the infant. The Play Area is centrally located with a soft blue rug, providing a safe and accessible space for play. The Diaper Changing Zone is adjacent to the crib, featuring a changing table for convenience. Storage is managed with a dresser on the west wall, while lighting is strategically placed to enhance the room's ambiance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sleeping Area, a classic white wooden crib measuring 1.4 meters by 0.7 meters by 1.0 meter is recommended. The Caregiver's Comfort Zone includes a pastel yellow rocking chair, 0.8 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.0 meter, complementing the crib. The Play Area features a soft blue rug, 2.5 meters by 2.0 meters, providing a plush surface. The Diaper Changing Zone includes a white wooden changing table, 1.0 meter by 0.5 meter by 1.0 meter, placed for easy access. Storage needs are met with a classic white dresser, 0.9 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.2 meters, on the west wall. Lighting is provided by a soft yellow nightlight, 0.4 meters by 0.365 meters by 0.436 meters, and a multicolor mobile, 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.5 meters, for visual stimulation above the crib.

## 4. Scene Graph
The crib is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to maximize space for functionality and safety. Its dimensions (1.4m x 0.7m x 1.0m) fit comfortably, ensuring stability and making it a focal point in the nursery. This placement allows the crib to face the north wall, providing a soothing view for the child and easy access for parents, while not blocking natural light.

The rocking chair is positioned to the left of the crib, also against the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.6m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably, maintaining balance and proportion in the room. This placement ensures interaction with the crib, enhancing functionality and aesthetic charm.

The rug is centrally located in the room, providing a play area that is easily accessible from both the crib and the rocking chair. Its dimensions (2.5m x 2.0m) fit well within the room, ensuring no obstruction or conflict with other objects, while maintaining balance and proportion.

The changing table is placed to the right of the crib on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.5m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably, maintaining a cohesive design with the crib and ensuring easy access for diaper changes.

The dresser is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall. Its dimensions (0.9m x 0.5m x 1.2m) provide storage while complementing the existing layout, maintaining spatial harmony and functionality.

The nightlight is placed on the changing table, facing the north wall, ensuring it is adjacent to and slightly behind the crib. This placement provides night lighting while maintaining safety and aesthetic appeal.

The mobile is placed above the crib, aligned with the ceiling, facing the north wall. Its position enhances the room's aesthetic by adding color and visual interest, while being functionally appropriate for the nursery setting.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the length of the south wall being too small to accommodate all intended objects, including the crib, rocking chair, changing table, and floor lamp. To resolve this, the floor lamp was removed, as it was deemed the least critical for the user's preference and the room's functionality. This decision maintained the charming nursery aesthetic with the essential elements intact, ensuring a functional and visually appealing space.
