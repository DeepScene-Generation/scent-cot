## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a tranquil yoga studio designed to foster a serene atmosphere conducive to yoga practice. Key elements include a light wood floor, woven mats, and a white shelf for storing yoga props. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, is intended to provide a spacious open area for yoga practice while efficiently accommodating storage needs. The user emphasizes a minimalist aesthetic, with a preference for natural materials and a harmonious, organized space.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The central area is designated as the Yoga Practice Area, featuring a light wood floor and woven mats for individual practice. The Prop Storage Area is located against the north wall, where a white shelf is intended to store yoga props. The Lighting Area involves ceiling lighting to enhance the ambiance, while the Decor Area includes a small indoor plant to contribute to the natural and calming environment.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Yoga Practice Area, woven yoga mats are recommended to match the user's description. The Prop Storage Area includes a modern white shelf for storing yoga props such as blocks, straps, and bolsters. The Lighting Area features a modern ceiling light fixture to provide soft, ambient lighting. Additionally, a small indoor plant is suggested to enhance the natural and calming environment of the studio, aligning with the user's preference for a tranquil space.

## 4. Scene Graph
The first object, yoga_mat_1, is placed in the middle of the room, serving as a primary element for yoga practice. Its dimensions are 1.8 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.02 meters, and it is oriented towards the north wall. This central placement allows ample space around it for free movement, aligning with the user's preference for a tranquil studio and adhering to design principles of balance and proportion.

Yoga_mat_2, measuring 1.8 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.02 meters, is placed parallel and adjacent to yoga_mat_1, also facing the north wall. This placement ensures both mats are aligned, allowing two individuals to practice simultaneously without obstruction, maintaining the room's organized and tranquil aesthetic.

The prop_shelf_1, a modern white shelf measuring 1.5 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.8 meters, is placed against the north wall. This location maximizes floor space for yoga practice and provides convenient access to props. The shelf's placement complements the minimalist style of the mats and the light wood floor, ensuring the yoga area remains clear and organized.

Ceiling_light_1, a modern fixture made of metal and glass, is centrally placed on the ceiling, measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.3 meters. This placement provides balanced lighting across the room, preventing shadows on the yoga mats or prop shelf, and complements the tranquil atmosphere of the studio.

Yoga_block_1, a minimalist cork block measuring 0.23 meters by 0.15 meters by 0.1 meters, is stored on the prop shelf against the north wall. This placement ensures easy access while maintaining the room's neat appearance, aligning with the user's preference for a tranquil and organized studio.

Yoga_strap_1, made of cotton and measuring 0.146 meters by 0.044 meters by 0.013 meters, is also placed on the prop shelf, adjacent to the yoga block. This ensures it is organized and accessible, maintaining the room's minimalist aesthetic.

Finally, indoor_plant_1, a natural element in a ceramic pot, is placed against the south wall, measuring 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.6 meters. This placement enhances the room's aesthetics without obstructing the yoga practice area, contributing to the tranquil and natural environment desired by the user.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to limited space on the prop shelf and in the middle of the room. The prop shelf could not accommodate all props, leading to the removal of yoga_bolster_1, as it was deemed less critical for the user's preference and room functionality. Additionally, the middle of the room was too small to accommodate all three yoga mats, resulting in the removal of yoga_mat_3 to maintain the room's open and tranquil atmosphere. These adjustments ensured the room remained functional and aligned with the user's vision for a serene yoga studio.
