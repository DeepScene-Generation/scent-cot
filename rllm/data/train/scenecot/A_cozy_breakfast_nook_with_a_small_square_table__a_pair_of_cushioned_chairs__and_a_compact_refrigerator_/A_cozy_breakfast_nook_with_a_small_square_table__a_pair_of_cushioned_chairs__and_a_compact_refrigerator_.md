## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a cozy breakfast nook within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary elements include a small square table, a pair of cushioned chairs, and a compact refrigerator. The user desires a warm and inviting atmosphere, enhanced by ceiling lighting, and suggests additional items such as a small rug, a wall clock, a shelf for extra storage, and a decorative plant. The design should maintain simplicity and warmth, focusing on essential elements that complement the nook's functionality and aesthetics.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures. The Breakfast Table Area is centrally located, featuring a small table and chairs for dining. The Refrigerator Nook is positioned against the south wall, providing easy access to stored breakfast items. Ceiling Lighting is intended to enhance the ambiance, while additional elements like a rug, wall clock, shelf, and plant are strategically placed to enhance functionality and aesthetics without overcrowding the space.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Breakfast Table Area, a minimalist wooden table (0.8m x 0.8m x 0.75m) and two cushioned chairs (each 0.5m x 0.5m x 0.9m) are recommended. The Refrigerator Nook features a modern metal refrigerator (0.6m x 0.6m x 1.5m). A contemporary glass pendant light (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.3m) is suggested for ceiling lighting. A bohemian wool rug (1.0m x 1.0m x 0.01m) defines the dining area, while a modern metal wall clock (0.3m x 0.05m x 0.3m) and a minimalist wooden shelf (0.6m x 0.2m x 0.8m) provide functionality and style. A natural ceramic plant (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.5m) adds a touch of greenery.

## 4. Scene Graph
The table is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to maintain balance and provide space for chairs and the refrigerator. Its minimalist style and light brown color complement the cozy atmosphere. The table's central placement allows for functional space around it, adhering to design principles and user preferences.

Chair 1 is positioned to the left of the table, facing the east wall. This placement ensures balance and ease of conversation, aligning with the user's vision of a cozy nook. The chair's beige color and fabric material enhance the room's warmth and simplicity.

Chair 2 is placed to the right of the table, facing the west wall, maintaining symmetry with Chair 1. This arrangement ensures both chairs are adjacent to the table, providing easy access and enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the nook.

The refrigerator is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, to prevent visual and spatial congestion. Its modern silver design complements the room's style, and its placement ensures easy access without disrupting the dining area.

The pendant light is suspended from the ceiling directly above the table, providing focused lighting on the dining area. Its soft white color and contemporary style enhance the room's ambiance, ensuring balanced light distribution.

The rug is placed centrally under the table and chairs, defining the dining area and adding texture and color. Its earth tones complement the minimalist furniture, creating a cohesive and cozy atmosphere.

The wall clock is mounted on the west wall, facing the east wall, providing optimal visibility from the seating area. Its modern black metal design contrasts well with the room's color palette, contributing to the overall balance and function of the nook.

The shelf is placed above the refrigerator on the east wall, optimizing vertical space and maintaining an uncluttered floor. Its minimalist style and white color enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic.

The plant is placed in the south-west corner, facing the north-east, adding greenery without obstructing movement or view. Its natural style and green color enhance the cozy atmosphere, complementing the room's warm tones and materials.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were strategically placed to avoid spatial congestion and maintain the room's cozy and functional atmosphere. The arrangement adheres to user preferences and design principles, ensuring a balanced and aesthetically pleasing breakfast nook.
