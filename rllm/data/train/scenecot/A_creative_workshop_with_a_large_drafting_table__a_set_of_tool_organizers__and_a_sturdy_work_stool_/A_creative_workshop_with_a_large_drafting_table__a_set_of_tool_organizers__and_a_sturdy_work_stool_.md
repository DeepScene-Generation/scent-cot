## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a creative workshop that emphasizes drafting, organization, and comfort. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, is designed around a large drafting table, which is central to the room's functionality. Key elements include tool organizers and a sturdy work stool, reflecting the user's need for an organized and ergonomic workspace. Additional items such as a task lamp, pegboard, and storage cabinet are suggested to enhance functionality, while artwork and a pinboard are considered for inspiration and personalization. The overall aesthetic leans towards an industrial style, with a focus on maintaining a tidy and efficient workspace.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Drafting Area is centered around the drafting table, providing ample space for sketching and drafting. The Tool Organization Area is designated along the east wall, featuring tool organizers and a pegboard for efficient storage and accessibility. The Storage Area is located on the west wall, housing a storage cabinet for additional supplies. The Inspiration Zone is on the south wall, where artwork is displayed to inspire creativity. Each substructure serves a specific purpose, contributing to the room's overall functionality and aesthetic.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Drafting Area, a large industrial-style drafting table (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.9m) is recommended, accompanied by an ergonomic work stool (0.386m x 0.43m x 0.807m) for comfort. The Tool Organization Area features a metal tool organizer (1.5m x 0.2m x 1.0m) and a pegboard (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.5m) to keep tools accessible and organized. The Storage Area includes a metal storage cabinet (1.0m x 0.5m x 1.2m) for additional supplies. In the Inspiration Zone, a contemporary artwork (0.95m x 0.02m x 1.4m) is displayed to enhance the creative atmosphere. A modern task lamp (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) is recommended for focused lighting on the drafting table.

## 4. Scene Graph
The drafting table is placed against the north wall, facing it, to maximize space efficiency and provide a stable backdrop for drafting activities. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.9m) allow it to serve as the central piece of the workshop, aligning with the user's preference for a functional and organized workspace. The work stool, initially intended to be in front of the drafting table, is repositioned under the table due to spatial constraints, facing the drafting table to ensure ease of use and comfort during long hours of work.

The tool organizer is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, to maintain accessibility from the drafting table while keeping the workspace organized. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.2m x 1.0m) ensure it fits comfortably without obstructing movement. The task lamp is placed on the drafting table, facing the south wall, to provide focused lighting for detailed work, enhancing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The pegboard is also placed on the east wall, towards the south end, to create a cohesive tool organization area. Its placement ensures easy access from the drafting table, contributing to the room's functionality. The storage cabinet is positioned against the west wall, facing the east wall, providing necessary storage without obstructing access to other tools. Its industrial style complements the existing furniture, maintaining a coherent aesthetic.

Finally, the artwork is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, ensuring it is visible from the drafting table and serves as a source of inspiration. Its contemporary style adds a creative touch to the industrial-themed room, enhancing the overall atmosphere.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the initial placement of the work stool in front of the drafting table, as it would be out of bounds. To resolve this, the stool was repositioned under the drafting table, maintaining functionality and accessibility. Additionally, a conflict between the artwork and the pinboard on the south wall was identified due to limited space. To address this, the pinboard was removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a creative workshop with a large drafting table, tool organizers, and a sturdy work stool. This adjustment ensures the room remains functional and aligned with the user's vision.
