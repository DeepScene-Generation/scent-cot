## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a chic salon that includes essential components such as a styling chair, a large mirror, and a metal trolley for tools. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes a modern and chic aesthetic, with a focus on functionality and style. The salon should accommodate these elements while maintaining an open and inviting atmosphere, ensuring that the space is not overcrowded.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The salon is divided into three main substructures: the Styling Chair and Mirror Area, the Tool Storage Area, and the North Wall with Mirror. The Styling Chair and Mirror Area is central to the salon's function, providing a space for client interaction and styling. The Tool Storage Area is designated for the metal trolley, ensuring tools are organized and easily accessible. The North Wall with Mirror serves as a focal point, enhancing the room's spatial depth and aesthetic appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Styling Chair and Mirror Area, a modern black leather styling chair and a large silver mirror are recommended. The chair is ergonomic, ensuring client comfort, while the mirror enhances spatial depth. The Tool Storage Area features an industrial-style metal trolley, providing functional and mobile tool storage. Additional recommendations include a modern styling station for tool organization, a central light fixture for illumination, and two gray fabric waiting seats to accommodate clients, maintaining a welcoming ambiance.

## 4. Scene Graph
The styling chair, a central piece for client seating, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions are 0.627 meters in length, 0.603 meters in width, and 0.778 meters in height. This placement maximizes functionality and complements the chic salon style, allowing ample space for the mirror and trolley. The large mirror, measuring 1.5 meters in length, 0.05 meters in width, and 2.0 meters in height, is placed on the north wall, directly opposite the styling chair. This positioning ensures optimal functionality and aligns with the salon's aesthetic, serving as a focal point. The metal trolley, with dimensions of 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.0 meter, is placed to the right of the styling chair, facing the north wall. This ensures easy access to tools, maintaining a chic and functional setup. The styling station, measuring 1.08 meters by 0.395 meters by 1.065 meters, is placed on the south wall to the left of the styling chair, facing the north wall. This arrangement complements the existing setup, providing a balanced and functional layout. The light fixture, with dimensions of 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.2 meters, is centrally placed on the ceiling, ensuring even illumination throughout the room. This placement aligns with the modern, chic style of the salon. The waiting seats, each measuring 0.7 meters by 0.535 meters by 0.801 meters, are placed in the middle of the room, facing the north wall. This arrangement provides a cohesive seating area for clients, maintaining balance and accessibility.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited length of the south wall, which could not accommodate all intended objects. The objects involved were the styling station, metal trolley, floor mat, styling chair, and mirror. To resolve this, the floor mat was removed, as it was deemed the least critical to the user's preference for a chic salon with a styling chair, large mirror, and metal trolley. This adjustment ensured the room maintained its functionality and aesthetic without overcrowding.
