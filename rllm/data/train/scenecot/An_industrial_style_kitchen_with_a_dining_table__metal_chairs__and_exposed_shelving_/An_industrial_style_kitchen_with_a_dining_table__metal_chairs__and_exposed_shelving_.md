## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires an industrial-style kitchen that includes a dining table, metal chairs, and exposed shelving. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for multiple functional areas. The user emphasizes the need for a robust dining table and metal chairs as central elements for socializing and dining. Additionally, the kitchen should feature exposed shelving for storage, stainless steel appliances for cooking, and a lighting system that enhances the industrial aesthetic while ensuring functionality.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Dining Table Area is central to the room, serving as the primary space for dining and social interaction. The Exposed Shelving Area is designated for storage, enhancing the industrial theme with visible metal shelving. The Cooking Station includes essential appliances like a stove and refrigerator, facilitating efficient food preparation. Lastly, the Lighting and Ventilation System ensures the kitchen remains well-lit and ventilated, with ceiling lights providing necessary illumination.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Dining Table Area, a robust industrial-style dining table measuring 2.0 meters by 1.0 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended, accompanied by four metal chairs, each measuring 0.557 meters by 0.617 meters by 0.931 meters. The Exposed Shelving Area features sturdy metal shelving units measuring 2.5 meters by 0.3 meters by 2.0 meters, aligning with the industrial theme. The Cooking Station includes a stainless steel stove (0.704 meters by 0.739 meters by 0.868 meters) and a refrigerator (0.8 meters by 0.7 meters by 1.8 meters), both essential for food preparation. The Lighting System incorporates a ceiling light (0.161 meters by 0.161 meters by 0.776 meters) to provide focused illumination over the dining area.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dining table is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall. This placement ensures balance and accessibility, allowing space on all sides for movement and seating. The table's industrial style, with its dark brown wood material, complements the desired aesthetic and serves as the focal point of the dining area. The placement process involved ensuring the table's dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.75m) fit the room's size, maintaining proportion and functionality.

Metal chairs are strategically placed around the dining table to provide seating. Metal Chair 1 is positioned to the left of the table, facing the east wall, while Metal Chair 2 is to the right, facing the west wall. Metal Chair 3 is placed in front of the table, facing the south wall, and Metal Chair 4 is behind the table, facing the north wall. This arrangement ensures symmetry and balance, adhering to the industrial style and providing functional seating for dining activities. Each chair's dimensions (0.557m x 0.617m x 0.931m) allow them to fit comfortably around the table without spatial conflicts.

The exposed shelving is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement maximizes space and accessibility, allowing the shelving to serve as a functional storage area while maintaining the industrial aesthetic. The shelving's dimensions (2.5m x 0.3m x 2.0m) fit the wall space, ensuring no interference with other objects in the room.

The stainless steel stove is positioned on the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement ensures accessibility and balance within the room, complementing the industrial style with its stainless steel material. The stove's dimensions (0.704m x 0.739m x 0.868m) allow it to fit comfortably without conflicting with the dining area.

The refrigerator is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. This location facilitates a functional cooking triangle with the stove, enhancing the kitchen's efficiency. The refrigerator's dimensions (0.8m x 0.7m x 1.8m) ensure it fits the available space without disrupting the room's flow.

The ceiling light is installed directly above the dining table, providing focused lighting for dining activities. Its placement on the ceiling ensures it does not interfere with other objects, maintaining the industrial aesthetic while providing necessary illumination. The light's compact size (0.161m x 0.161m x 0.776m) allows it to be suspended without spatial conflicts.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The layout accommodates all objects without spatial conflicts, maintaining balance and proportion within the room. Each object's placement aligns with the user's industrial style preference and ensures functionality and aesthetic appeal.
