## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a modern hallway that incorporates specific elements such as a console table, a decorative mirror, and a shoe rack, all while maintaining a minimalist aesthetic. The hallway should provide functionality for storage and allow for quick visual checks. The south wall is identified as the main focal area, where the console table and mirror will be placed to create a sleek and modern look. The console table is intended to hold personal items and decorative elements, while the mirror will enhance the sense of space. A minimalist shoe rack is also required for functional shoe storage without adding visual clutter. Additional recommendations include a decorative item on the console table and a small indoor plant to add personality and warmth to the space, ensuring the central open area remains clear for easy movement.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The hallway is decomposed into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The South Wall Area is the primary focal point, designated for the console table and decorative mirror to create a welcoming entryway. The Storage Area is defined by the placement of the shoe rack, ensuring easy access and minimal visual clutter. The Decorative Area includes additional items like a decorative bowl and a small indoor plant to enhance the hallway's aesthetic without compromising its minimalist appeal. The Central Open Area is kept clear to facilitate movement and maintain the minimalist design goals.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the South Wall Area, a sleek modern console table measuring 1.2 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.8 meters is recommended, along with a decorative mirror measuring 0.694 meters by 0.089 meters by 1.544 meters. The Storage Area features a minimalist metal shoe rack with dimensions of 1.0 meter by 0.3 meters by 0.5 meters. In the Decorative Area, a modern ceramic decorative bowl (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.1 meters) is suggested for the console table, along with a small indoor plant to add greenery and warmth.

## 4. Scene Graph
The console table is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, serving as the focal point of the hallway. Its placement maximizes space efficiency and fulfills its functionality of holding items conveniently accessible. The table's dimensions (1.2m x 0.4m x 0.8m) fit well against the wall, aligning with the user's preference for a modern hallway and complementing the idea of a sleek, welcoming entrance. The decorative mirror is positioned above the console table on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures it complements the console table's modern design, serves its intended functionality, and fulfills the user's input for a sleek hallway design. The shoe rack is placed to the right of the console table on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.3m x 0.5m) allow it to fit well beside the console table, maintaining a cohesive look and providing sufficient space for movement. The decorative bowl is placed on the console table, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.1m) fit comfortably on the table, enhancing the aesthetic appeal without cluttering the space.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts were identified due to the limited surface area of the console table, which could not accommodate all the intended objects, including the decorative bowl, indoor plant, and table lamp. To resolve this, the indoor plant and table lamp were removed based on their lower functional priority compared to the decorative bowl, which aligns more closely with the user's preference for a modern hallway with a sleek console table, decorative mirror, and minimalist shoe rack.
