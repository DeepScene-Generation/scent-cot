## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a functional garage workspace that emphasizes practicality and efficiency, centered around a solid workbench and a wall-mounted tool rack. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, is designed to support craftsmanship and creativity. Key elements include a workbench area on the south wall, a tool rack for organized tool access, and a clear middle space to facilitate movement. Adequate lighting is crucial for detailed work, and the workspace should avoid clutter to allow for the handling of larger materials. The user prefers an industrial style, and the total number of objects should not exceed 12.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The garage is divided into several functional substructures. The Workbench Area on the south wall is the primary zone for heavy-duty projects, requiring a solid workbench and seating. The Tool Rack Area, also on the south wall, provides organized access to tools. The Storage Area on the east wall offers additional storage solutions without obstructing the workspace. The Lighting Area focuses on providing adequate illumination over the workbench and throughout the garage. The Clear Middle Space ensures unobstructed movement and handling of materials.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Workbench Area, a robust industrial-style workbench (2.0m x 0.8m x 0.9m) and a supportive stool (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.7m) are recommended. The Tool Rack Area features a wall-mounted tool rack (1.5m x 0.2m x 1.0m) for organized tool access. The Storage Area includes a shelving unit (1.2m x 0.4m x 1.8m) and a storage bin (0.6m x 0.4m x 0.3m) for material storage. The Lighting Area is enhanced with a modern light fixture (1.0m x 0.2m x 0.2m) to ensure adequate illumination. Additional tools such as a power tool (0.362m x 0.262m x 0.07m) and a clamp (0.202m x 0.076m x 0.038m) are included for project work.

## 4. Scene Graph
The workbench is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to provide stability and easy access for heavy-duty projects. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.8m x 0.9m) fit comfortably within the room, leaving ample space for movement. This central placement ensures the workbench remains the focal point, aligning with the user's functional requirements and industrial style.

The tool rack is mounted on the south wall, adjacent to the workbench, providing organized tool access directly above or beside the workbench. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.2m x 1.0m) ensure it does not interfere with floor space, maintaining a cohesive industrial style and easy tool access during workbench activities.

The stool is placed to the left of the workbench, facing the east wall. This placement ensures comfortable seating while working, without obstructing the workspace. The stool's dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.7m) allow it to fit well within the room's aesthetic and functional requirements.

The shelving unit is positioned against the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.4m x 1.8m) provide additional storage without crowding the workspace. This placement ensures easy access from the workbench and stool, maintaining the industrial aesthetic.

The light fixture is installed on the ceiling, centrally aligned above the workbench, facing downward. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.2m x 0.2m) ensure it provides effective illumination for the workspace, enhancing functionality and maintaining balance.

The power tool is placed on the workbench, facing the north wall. Its compact size (0.362m x 0.262m x 0.07m) allows it to fit comfortably without obstructing the workspace, ensuring easy access during projects.

The storage bin is placed on the shelving unit against the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.4m x 0.3m) ensure it is accessible and does not obstruct the workspace, maintaining a functional and aesthetically pleasing environment.

The clamp is placed on the workbench, facing the north wall. Its small size (0.202m x 0.076m x 0.038m) allows it to be readily accessible during projects, maintaining both functionality and aesthetic consistency within the industrial-themed garage workspace.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed in a manner that respects the user's preferences for a functional and efficient workspace, adhering to design principles and maintaining the industrial aesthetic.

    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'on' relation
        - calculation:
            - No directional constraint applied
        - conclusion: No size constraint applied
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'east_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - storage_bin_1 size: length=0.6, width=0.4, height=0.3
            - Room size: 5.0x5.0x3.0
            - x_min = 5.0 - 0.4/2 = 4.8
            - x_max = 5.0 - 0.4/2 = 4.8
            - y_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 0.6/2 = 0.3
            - y_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 0.6/2 = 4.7
            - z_min = 1.5 - 3.0/2 + 0.3/2 = 0.15
            - z_max = 1.5 + 3.0/2 - 0.3/2 = 2.85
        - conclusion: Possible position: (4.8, 4.8, 0.3, 4.7, 0.15, 2.85)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(4.8-4.8), y(0.3-4.7)
            - Final coordinates: x=4.8, y=0.7336402731676454, z=1.95
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 4.8, y: 0.7336402731676454, z: 1.95
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=4.8, y=0.7336402731676454, z=1.95
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 4.8, y: 0.7336402731676454, z: 1.95
