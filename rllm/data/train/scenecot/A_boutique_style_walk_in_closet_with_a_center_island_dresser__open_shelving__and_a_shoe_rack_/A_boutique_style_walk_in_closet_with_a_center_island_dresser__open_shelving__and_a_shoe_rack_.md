## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a boutique-style walk-in closet that combines functionality with aesthetic appeal. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a center island dresser, open shelving, and a shoe rack, all designed to fulfill both functional and aesthetic needs. The user desires a luxurious ambiance, suggesting the use of premium materials like wood or marble. Additionally, a seating option such as an ottoman or bench is preferred for comfort, and ceiling lighting is essential for visibility and ambiance. The total number of objects should not exceed 18 to maintain a spacious feel.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Center Island Area is designated for the luxurious dresser, serving as the focal point for displaying accessories and jewelry. The Shelving Area is distributed along the walls to efficiently display clothing items, with multiple units ensuring structural support. The Shoe Rack Area is positioned against the east wall for organizing shoes elegantly. The Seating Area includes an ottoman for comfort and style, complementing the room's design. Finally, the Lighting Area focuses on ceiling lighting to enhance visibility and contribute to the room's elegance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Center Island Area, a luxurious white marble dresser measuring 1.5 meters by 1.0 meter by 1.0 meter is recommended. The Shelving Area features modern wooden shelving units, each 1.0 meter by 0.3 meters by 2.0 meters, placed along the south, north, east, and west walls. The Shoe Rack Area includes an elegant metal shoe rack, 1.2 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.5 meters, positioned on the south wall. The Seating Area is enhanced with a chic gray fabric ottoman, 0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.45 meters, placed adjacent to the center island dresser. For the Lighting Area, a modern crystal chandelier, 0.494 meters by 0.494 meters by 1.24 meters, is installed on the ceiling to provide ambient lighting.

## 4. Scene Graph
The center island dresser is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.5m x 1.0m x 1.0m) allow for comfortable walking space around it, making it the focal point of the room. This placement ensures easy access from all sides, aligning with design principles of balance and proportion. The luxurious style and white marble material enhance the aesthetic appeal, making it a standout feature.

Shelving Unit 1 is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.3m x 2.0m) ensure it does not interfere with the center island dresser. This placement supports a boutique-style walk-in closet by effectively utilizing wall space for open display, maintaining balance and proportion.

Shelving Unit 2 is positioned on the north wall, facing the south wall. This symmetrical placement with Shelving Unit 1 creates a balanced and visually appealing layout. The dimensions (1.0m x 0.3m x 2.0m) allow ample space for displaying items without overcrowding, enhancing functionality and aesthetics.

Shelving Unit 3 is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.3m x 2.0m) fit well within the available space, ensuring no spatial conflict with the center island dresser. This placement maintains balance and proportion, allowing easy access to displayed items.

Shelving Unit 4 is positioned on the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement maintains symmetry and balance in the room layout. The dimensions (1.0m x 0.3m x 2.0m) fit well within the wall's dimensions, complementing the existing shelving units and providing additional display space.

The shoe rack is placed on the south wall, adjacent to Shelving Unit 1, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.3m x 1.5m) ensure no spatial conflicts. This placement adds a dedicated area for shoes, adhering to design principles of balance and proportion.

The ottoman is placed adjacent to the center island dresser, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.8m x 0.45m) ensure it does not obstruct movement. This placement provides a seating area, essential for a boutique-style walk-in closet, enhancing functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The chandelier is centrally placed on the ceiling, above the center island dresser. Its dimensions (0.494m x 0.494m x 1.24m) are manageable within the ceiling height. This placement provides balanced lighting across the closet area, enhancing the boutique aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
There are no conflicts detected in the current layout. All objects are placed in a manner that adheres to the user's preferences and design principles, ensuring a cohesive and functional boutique-style walk-in closet.

        - conclusion: No rotation difference calculation needed
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'west_wall' relation
        - calculation:
            - No child objects, no size constraint needed
        - conclusion: No size constraint applied
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'west_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - shelving_unit_4 size: length=1.0, width=0.3, height=2.0
            - Room size: 5.0x5.0x3.0
            - x_min = 0 + 1 * 0.0/2 + 1 * 0.3/2 = 0.15
            - x_max = 0 + 1 * 0.0/2 + 1 * 0.3/2 = 0.15
            - y_min = 2.5 + -1 * 5.0/2 + 1 * 1.0/2 = 0.5
            - y_max = 2.5 + 1 * 5.0/2 + -1 * 1.0/2 = 4.5
            - z_min = z_max = 2.0/2 = 1.0
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.15, 0.15, 0.5, 4.5, 1.0, 1.0)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.15-0.15), y(0.5-4.5)
            - Final coordinates: x=0.15, y=1.931748961699908, z=1.0
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.15, y: 1.931748961699908, z: 1.0
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=0.15, y=1.931748961699908, z=1.0
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.15, y: 1.931748961699908, z: 1.0
