## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a rustic kitchen that embodies a warm, cozy farmhouse style, focusing on meal preparation, cleaning, and storage. Key elements include a farmhouse sink and a classic wooden island, with an emphasis on harmonizing rustic aesthetics with functionality. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for the desired layout. The user prioritizes a central meal preparation area, efficient cleaning facilities, and accessible storage, all while maintaining a cohesive rustic theme.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The central area is designated for the wooden island, serving as the primary meal preparation zone. The north wall is allocated for the farmhouse sink, ensuring easy access to cleaning facilities. Wooden cabinetry is placed along the east and west walls to provide ample storage for kitchenware and ingredients. Exposed wooden beams on the ceiling enhance the rustic aesthetic and structural integrity. Additionally, a dining area is created in the middle of the room, featuring a dining table and chairs to facilitate social interaction and dining.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central meal preparation area, a classic wooden island measuring 2.0 meters by 1.2 meters by 0.9 meters is recommended, aligning with the rustic style. The farmhouse sink, measuring 0.8 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.3 meters, is placed under the window on the north wall to utilize natural lighting. Wooden cabinetry, each measuring 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 2.0 meters, is suggested for both the east and west walls to maximize storage. Exposed beams, 5.0 meters in length, are recommended for the ceiling to reinforce the rustic theme. The dining area includes a rustic wooden dining table (1.8 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.75 meters) and four chairs (each 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meters) to complete the farmhouse aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden island is a central piece in the rustic kitchen, serving as a functional and aesthetic element for meal preparation. It is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall, to allow movement around it from all sides, ensuring it doesn't obstruct access to other kitchen elements like the sink or cabinetry. This placement aligns with the user's desire for a rustic kitchen, where the island acts as a focal point, adhering to balance and proportion principles.

The farmhouse sink is positioned on the north wall, facing the south wall, to accommodate plumbing needs and free up space in the middle of the room. This placement ensures no spatial conflict with the wooden island and maintains functionality by providing easy access for cleaning tasks. It complements the rustic style and enhances the kitchen's aesthetic.

Wooden cabinetry is placed against the east and west walls, facing the opposite walls to maintain visual balance. This placement ensures stability and complements the farmhouse sink and wooden island, providing easy access to storage while aligning with the rustic theme. The cabinetry's dimensions (1.5m x 0.5m x 2.0m) fit comfortably against the walls, enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic.

Exposed beams are placed on the ceiling, spanning the length of the room. This placement enhances the rustic aesthetic without interfering with the floor space or existing objects. The beams create a visual connection with the wooden cabinetry and island, emphasizing the rustic theme and adding structural integrity.

The dining table is placed in the middle of the room, facing the north wall, adjacent to the wooden island. This placement facilitates a seamless flow between meal preparation and dining activities, ensuring both functionality and aesthetic appeal. The table's rustic design complements the existing elements, maintaining the kitchen's charm.

Chair 1 is placed in front of the dining table, facing it, to ensure functionality for dining purposes and maintain the rustic aesthetic. Chair 2 is positioned to the right of the dining table, facing the west wall, providing seating access from both sides of the table. Chair 3 is placed behind the dining table, facing the north wall, creating a balanced seating arrangement. Chair 4 is positioned in front of the dining table, facing the south wall, completing the seating arrangement and enhancing functionality.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with Chair 1's initial placement left of the dining table due to the presence of the wooden island. To resolve this, Chair 1 was repositioned in front of the dining table, facing it, ensuring no spatial conflicts and maintaining the rustic aesthetic. This adjustment preserves the room's functionality and visual balance, aligning with the user's preferences and design principles.
