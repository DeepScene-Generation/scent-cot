## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a tranquil sunroom designed for relaxation and a connection with nature. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, is intended to feature a wicker chair set, a round table, and hanging plants. Large windows on the south wall are a key feature, providing ample natural light to enhance the serene atmosphere. The user desires a bohemian style that integrates natural elements, with a focus on maintaining an uncluttered and harmonious space.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main substructures: the Seating Area, the Natural Lighting Zone, and the Hanging Plant Zone. The Seating Area is designed to accommodate comfortable furniture without overcrowding, focusing on relaxation. The Natural Lighting Zone, centered around the south wall windows, maximizes sunlight exposure. The Hanging Plant Zone utilizes ceiling space to add vertical interest and greenery, contributing to the room's tranquil ambiance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a bohemian-style wicker chair set is recommended, consisting of two chairs with dimensions of 0.8 meters by 0.8 meters each. A round table, measuring 1.0 meter in diameter, serves as the central piece. Hanging plants in ceramic pots, each 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters, are suggested for the Hanging Plant Zone to enhance the natural aesthetic. These objects are chosen for their style, functionality, and ability to complement the room's serene and bohemian theme.

## 4. Scene Graph
The first wicker chair (wicker_chair_1) is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to maximize sunlight and provide a view, aligning with the user's vision of a tranquil sunroom. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.8m x 1.0m) ensure it fits comfortably without obstructing pathways. The second wicker chair (wicker_chair_2) is placed next to the first, maintaining symmetry and balance, crucial for a cohesive seating arrangement. The round table (round_table_1), with dimensions of 1.0m x 1.0m x 0.75m, is centrally located to serve as a focal point, accessible from both chairs and maintaining a balanced aesthetic. Hanging plants are strategically placed on the ceiling: hanging_plant_1 above the round table, hanging_plant_2 above the seating area, and hanging_plant_3 near the east wall, ensuring even distribution and visual interest without obstructing movement or views.

## 5. Global Check
Initially, conflicts arose due to spatial constraints on the south wall, where the side table and floor lamp were intended to be placed. The side table, originally positioned between the wicker chairs, conflicted with the available space. Similarly, the floor lamp's placement was problematic due to its proximity to the side table and chairs. To resolve these conflicts, the side table and floor lamp were removed, as they were deemed less critical to the user's preference for a tranquil sunroom with a focus on the wicker chair set, round table, and hanging plants. This decision ensured the room remained uncluttered and aligned with the user's vision.
