## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a minimalist bathroom characterized by simplicity and coherence in color, with a focus on avoiding visual clutter. Essential components include a white ceramic sink, a modern faucet, and a large mirror. The room's dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design emphasizes ergonomic access and sufficient reflection for grooming, facilitated by the large mirror. The user prefers a minimalist aesthetic, which means the space should remain uncluttered with clean lines and a cohesive color palette. Additional essential objects, such as a towel rack, are recommended to complement the existing components and support daily hygiene tasks.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The bathroom is decomposed into several substructures based on user requirements. The Sink Area is designated for the white ceramic sink, modern faucet, and large mirror, serving as the focal point for grooming activities. The Towel Area is intended for the towel rack, providing easy access for drying hands. The Storage Area is for the storage compartment, ensuring bathroom essentials are organized and accessible. The Toilet Area is separate from the sink area, providing privacy and functionality. The Lighting Area focuses on ambient lighting to enhance the minimalist aesthetic, while the Floor Area includes a bath mat for comfort and safety.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sink Area, a minimalist white ceramic sink with dimensions of 0.6 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.15 meters is recommended, along with a modern metal faucet measuring 0.1 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.15 meters. A large minimalist mirror (1.0 meters by 0.02 meters by 0.8 meters) is suggested to provide adequate reflection. In the Towel Area, a minimalist metallic towel rack (0.5 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.1 meters) is proposed. The Storage Area features a minimalist white wooden storage compartment (0.8 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.8 meters) for organizing bathroom essentials. The Toilet Area includes a minimalist ceramic toilet (0.7 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.75 meters). The Lighting Area is enhanced with a modern metal light fixture (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.1 meters) for ambient lighting. A minimalist cotton bath mat (0.8 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.02 meters) is recommended for the Floor Area to provide comfort and safety.

## 4. Scene Graph
The sink is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, as it is a central feature of the bathroom. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.5m x 0.15m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall without overcrowding, creating a minimalist focal point. The placement ensures ergonomic access and aligns with the user's preference for a minimalist design, maintaining balance and proportion.

The faucet is positioned directly above the sink, facing the north wall. Its compact size (0.1m x 0.05m x 0.15m) allows it to fit on the sink without overwhelming the space. This placement ensures optimal functionality and complements the minimalist style of the sink, aligning with the user's input for a minimalist bathroom.

The mirror is placed on the south wall directly above the sink, facing the north wall. Its size (1.0m x 0.02m x 0.8m) provides adequate reflection without overpowering the minimalist design. This placement ensures functional use during grooming and visual coherence, adhering to the user's minimalist preference.

The towel rack is placed on the south wall, to the right of the sink, at a height of approximately 1.2 meters from the floor. It faces the north wall, consistent with the positioning of the sink and mirror. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.1m x 0.1m) ensure it does not interfere with the sink, faucet, or mirror, providing a functional yet subtle addition to the wall.

The storage compartment is placed on the south wall, left of the sink, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.4m x 0.8m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing other objects. This placement ensures functionality and aesthetic coherence, supporting the minimalist theme and providing easy access to bathroom essentials.

The bath mat is placed on the floor in front of the sink, aligned centrally with the sink to ensure even balance. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.6m x 0.02m) allow it to fit without interfering with movement within the bathroom, maintaining the user’s minimalist aesthetic.

The toilet is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. Its dimensions (0.7m x 0.4m x 0.75m) allow it to fit comfortably without overlapping other objects. This placement provides privacy and separation of functionalities, maintaining an open and clean aesthetic.

The light fixture is placed on the ceiling in the middle of the room, directly above the bath mat for centered illumination. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.1m) ensure it does not interfere with floor or wall-mounted objects, providing adequate lighting for the entire bathroom space.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the placement of the soap dispenser, as the width of the faucet was too small to accommodate it left of the faucet. To resolve this, the soap dispenser was removed based on its lower functional priority compared to the other essential components like the sink, faucet, and mirror. This decision aligns with the user's preference for a minimalist bathroom, ensuring the space remains uncluttered and functional.
