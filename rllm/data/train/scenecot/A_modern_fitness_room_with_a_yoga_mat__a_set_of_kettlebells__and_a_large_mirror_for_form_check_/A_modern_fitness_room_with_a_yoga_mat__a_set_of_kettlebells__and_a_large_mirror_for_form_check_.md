## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a modern fitness room equipped with a yoga mat, a set of kettlebells, and a large mirror for form checking. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design emphasizes an open and airy atmosphere with a modern and clean aesthetic. Key functional needs include a central area for yoga and stretching, a mirror for form checking, and storage for kettlebells along the west wall. Additional implicit requirements include seating for rest, storage for miscellaneous items, and lighting solutions to enhance the room's modern aesthetic.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The central area is designated for yoga and stretching, ensuring ample space for movement. The south wall is allocated for the large mirror, providing a clear reflection area for form checking. The west wall is reserved for kettlebell storage, ensuring easy access without obstructing the central workout space. Additional substructures include a seating and storage area along the west wall and lighting solutions on the ceiling to enhance the room's modern aesthetic.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central yoga and stretching area, a modern rubber yoga mat measuring 1.8 meters by 0.6 meters is recommended. A large glass mirror, 2.0 meters by 2.5 meters, is proposed for the south wall to facilitate form checking. The west wall will house a set of modern metal kettlebells, each measuring 0.3 meters in all dimensions, ensuring they are easily accessible. A modern wooden storage bench, 1.2 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.5 meters, is suggested for storage and seating. A modern plastic wall clock, 0.5 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.5 meters, will be placed for time tracking. Finally, a modern metal light fixture, 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.2 meters, will be installed on the ceiling to provide ambient lighting.

## 4. Scene Graph
The yoga mat is placed in the middle of the room, serving as the focal point for yoga and stretching exercises. Its central placement ensures visibility and accessibility, adhering to modern design principles by offering balance and symmetry. The mat's dimensions (1.8m x 0.6m x 0.02m) allow for full utilization of space, and it is oriented parallel to the walls to maximize space usage.

The mirror is mounted on the north wall, facing the south wall, to provide a clear reflection area for form checking. This placement avoids direct sunlight glare and ensures visibility from the yoga mat. The mirror's dimensions (2.0m x 0.05m x 2.5m) fit well on the wall, maintaining balance and proportion within the room.

The kettlebells are placed on the south wall, adjacent to each other, ensuring easy access without obstructing the yoga mat. Each kettlebell measures 0.3 meters in all dimensions, and their placement maintains an open central space, aligning with the room's modern aesthetic.

The storage bench is positioned on the west wall, facing the east wall, providing seating and storage without interfering with the yoga mat or kettlebells. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.4m x 0.5m) ensure it fits comfortably against the wall, maintaining balance and functionality.

The wall clock is placed on the south wall above the kettlebells, ensuring visibility from the center of the room. Its small size (0.5m x 0.05m x 0.5m) allows it to occupy minimal space while providing essential time-tracking functionality.

The light fixture is mounted on the ceiling, centered in the room, to provide even lighting distribution. Its modern style complements the room's aesthetic, and its placement ensures it does not interfere with other objects, enhancing the room's functionality and design.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were strategically placed to ensure functionality and aesthetic appeal, maintaining an open and modern fitness space. The room's layout supports the user's requirements and preferences, with each object contributing to the overall design and functionality.
