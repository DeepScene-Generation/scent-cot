## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a spacious garage designed to support John's hobby of building and repairing, with a focus on maintaining a clean and organized appearance. The garage, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, is to be equipped with a workbench, storage cabinets, and a bicycle hanging from the wall. The user emphasizes the need for a functional workspace that includes a workbench area with a pegboard and stool, a storage cabinet area for various items, and a bicycle storage area that utilizes vertical space. Additionally, an open project area in the middle of the room is required for working on projects, with adequate lighting to support detailed work.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The garage is divided into several key substructures based on the user's requirements. The Workbench Area is located on the south wall, designed for tinkering activities and equipped with a workbench, pegboard, and work stool. The Storage Cabinet Area is positioned on the north wall, featuring storage cabinets to house various items and a ladder for accessing higher shelves. The Bicycle Storage Area is on the east wall, utilizing vertical space to hang the bicycle and keep the floor clear. Finally, the Open Project Area occupies the middle of the room, providing ample space for projects and requiring overhead lighting for visibility.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Workbench Area, an industrial-style workbench (2.0m x 0.7m x 0.9m) is recommended, along with a metal pegboard (1.8m x 0.05m x 1.0m) for tool organization and a metal work stool (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.75m) for seating. The Storage Cabinet Area includes two industrial metal storage cabinets (each 1.2m x 0.5m x 2.0m) and a ladder (0.6m x 0.15m x 1.8m) for accessing higher storage. The Bicycle Storage Area features a modern metal bicycle (1.8m x 0.6m x 1.1m) and a bike mount (0.4m x 0.2m x 0.1m) for hanging the bicycle. An overhead light (1.0m x 0.2m x 0.2m) is recommended for the Open Project Area to ensure adequate lighting.

## 4. Scene Graph
The workbench is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, to maximize space for movement and workspace accessibility. Its industrial style and dimensions (2.0m x 0.7m x 0.9m) make it a functional element that aligns with user preferences for a spacious garage. The pegboard is mounted directly above the workbench on the south wall, facing the north wall, providing organized tool storage without occupying floor space. The work stool is positioned in front of the workbench, facing the south wall, ensuring it is functionally adjacent and enhancing the usability of the workspace.

The first storage cabinet is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall, to maintain a balanced layout and maximize floor space. The second storage cabinet is positioned to the left of the first cabinet on the north wall, creating a cohesive storage area. The ladder, initially planned for the north wall, was removed due to spatial constraints, prioritizing the storage cabinets for their higher functional importance.

The bicycle is hung on the east wall, facing the west wall, utilizing vertical space and keeping the floor clear. The bike mount is installed on the east wall to securely hold the bicycle, aligning with the user's vision of a spacious and organized garage. The overhead light is centrally placed on the ceiling, providing balanced lighting across the room and enhancing the functionality of the open project area.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited length of the north wall, which could not accommodate both storage cabinets and the ladder. To resolve this, the ladder was removed, as the storage cabinets were deemed more critical to the user's preference for a spacious garage with ample storage. This decision ensured the room's functionality and aesthetic goals were met without compromising the user's requirements.

            - z_max = 3.0 - 0.0/2 - 0.2/2 = 2.9
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.5, 4.5, 0.1, 4.9, 2.9, 2.9)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.5-4.5), y(0.1-4.9)
            - Final coordinates: x=2.6002, y=4.1364, z=2.9
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 2.6002, y: 4.1364, z: 2.9
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No other objects in proximity
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=2.6002, y=4.1364, z=2.9
        - conclusion: overhead_light_1 placed successfully
