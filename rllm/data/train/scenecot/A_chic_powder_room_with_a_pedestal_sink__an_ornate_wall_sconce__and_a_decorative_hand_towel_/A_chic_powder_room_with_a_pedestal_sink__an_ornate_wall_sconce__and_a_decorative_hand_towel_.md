## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a chic powder room that combines functionality with a luxurious aesthetic. Key elements include a pedestal sink, an ornate wall sconce, and a decorative hand towel, all contributing to a cohesive and elegant style. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design emphasizes a balance between functionality and visual appeal, with specific areas designated for lighting, the sink, and towel placement.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main substructures: the Pedestal Sink Area, the Towel Area, and the Lighting Area. The Pedestal Sink Area is the focal point, featuring the sink and a decorative mirror to enhance both functionality and style. The Towel Area is designed for easy access to a hand towel, adding elegance and practicality. The Lighting Area focuses on providing ambient illumination through an ornate wall sconce, contributing to the room's chic ambiance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Pedestal Sink Area, a chic ceramic pedestal sink and an ornate silver mirror are recommended to enhance the room's aesthetic and functionality. The Towel Area includes a stylish chrome towel ring to hold a decorative hand towel, ensuring easy access and adding elegance. The Lighting Area features an ornate bronze wall sconce to provide both illumination and decorative value. Additional recommendations include a small wooden shelf for storage, a beige decorative rug for comfort and style, and a modern glass soap dispenser to complement the chic design.

## 4. Scene Graph
The pedestal sink, a key functional element, is placed on the north wall facing the south wall. Its chic ceramic design and white color ensure it is a prominent feature upon entering the room, aligning with the user's preference for visibility and balance. The sink's dimensions are 0.5 meters in length, 0.4 meters in width, and 0.9 meters in height, allowing it to fit comfortably without spatial conflicts.

Above the pedestal sink, the decorative mirror is positioned on the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures functionality by allowing users to use the mirror while using the sink. The mirror's ornate silver design complements the chic style, with dimensions of 0.8 meters in length, 0.1 meters in width, and 1.0 meter in height, ensuring it aligns vertically with the sink without protruding into other areas.

The towel ring is placed on the north wall, right of the pedestal sink and below the decorative mirror. Its chrome finish adds an elegant touch, and its dimensions of 0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.05 meters ensure it does not interfere with the sink or mirror. This placement maintains balance and proportion, providing easy access for users.

The hand towel is draped over the towel ring, facing the south wall. This placement ensures functionality and enhances the room's aesthetic by utilizing the towel ring as a decorative element, aligning with the user's chic and decorative theme.

The wall sconce is placed on the north wall above the decorative mirror, facing the south wall. Its ornate bronze design provides direct lighting over the sink area, enhancing both functionality and aesthetics. The sconce's dimensions are 0.14 meters in length, 0.065 meters in width, and 0.151 meters in height, ensuring it fits without spatial conflicts.

The small shelf is placed on the north wall, left of the pedestal sink, maintaining balance and functionality. Its chic wooden design and dimensions of 0.6 meters by 0.25 meters by 0.2 meters ensure it complements the room's style without cluttering the space.

The decorative rug is centrally placed in the middle of the room, providing a focal point that enhances the room's chic design. Its beige color and dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.8 meters fit well within the available floor space, ensuring it does not interfere with other elements.

The soap dispenser is placed on the pedestal sink, ensuring functionality and accessibility for washing purposes. Its modern glass design and dimensions of 0.1 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.2 meters complement the chic aesthetic, maintaining balance and proportion.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were positioned to ensure functionality and aesthetic appeal, adhering to the user's preferences and design principles. The room's layout allows for clear movement and accessibility, maintaining a harmonious and chic environment.
