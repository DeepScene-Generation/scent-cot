## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a minimalist bedroom that includes three essential pieces of furniture: a double bed, a wardrobe, and a bedside table. The room's aesthetic should emphasize simplicity, spaciousness, and visual harmony, with a focus on neutral tones and simple forms. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user also expressed interest in potentially adding a lamp, a small chair, or a decorative plant to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetics, provided these additions do not compromise the minimalist design.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to align with the user's minimalist preferences. The Sleeping Area is designated for the double bed, positioned against the north wall to maximize space and provide a clear view across the room. The Storage Area is allocated for the wardrobe, placed against the west wall to maintain balance and accessibility. The Bedside Area includes the bedside table and lamp, positioned adjacent to the bed for convenience. Lastly, the Decorative Area is intended for the plant, placed on the east wall to add a touch of nature and balance the room's visual weight.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sleeping Area, a minimalist double bed with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters is recommended. The Storage Area features a sleek wardrobe measuring 1.8 meters by 0.6 meters by 2.2 meters, providing ample storage while maintaining clean lines. In the Bedside Area, a small wooden bedside table (0.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.5 meters) is suggested, accompanied by a minimalist metal lamp (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters) for functional lighting. The Decorative Area includes a ceramic plant (0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.9 meters) to enhance the room's aesthetic without cluttering the space.

## 4. Scene Graph
The double bed is the central feature of the room, placed against the north wall to maximize space and provide an unobstructed view. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.5m) fit comfortably within the room's width, allowing space for other furniture. This placement ensures no spatial conflicts and aligns with the minimalist design preference, maintaining balance and proportion while providing a comfortable sleeping area.

The wardrobe is positioned against the west wall, facing the east wall. Its dimensions (1.8m x 0.6m x 2.2m) allow it to fit seamlessly into the room without obstructing movement. This placement maintains balance and accessibility, aligning with the user's minimalist aesthetic and providing functional clothing storage.

The bedside table is placed on the floor to the right of the bed, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.4m x 0.5m) ensure it fits comfortably beside the bed without overlapping with the wardrobe. This placement maintains balance and proportion, providing easy access to nighttime essentials while adhering to the minimalist style.

The lamp is placed on the bedside table, providing essential lighting for the bedside area. Its small size (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) ensures it fits comfortably without causing spatial conflicts. This placement aligns with the minimalist style and enhances the room's functionality by providing necessary lighting.

The plant is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.9m) allow it to fit in the room without causing clutter. This placement balances the room layout and enhances the minimalist aesthetic by adding a natural decorative element, ensuring it stands out without being adjacent to other objects.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the placement of the chair, as the width of the bedside table was too small to accommodate the chair to its left. Given the user's preference for a minimalist bedroom with essential furniture, the chair was deemed the least important for the room's functionality and was removed. This resolution maintains the room's minimalist aesthetic and ensures optimal functionality without compromising space or movement.
