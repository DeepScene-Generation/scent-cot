## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires an industrial-style dining area characterized by a long wooden table, metal frame chairs, and a hanging metal light fixture. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes the need for an industrial aesthetic, incorporating raw materials and a warm ambiance. Functionally, the space must accommodate multiple diners with comfortable seating and adequate lighting, ensuring coherence with metal and wood elements.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The scene is decomposed into several substructures based on the user's requirements. The central substructure is the Dining Table Area, which serves as the focal point for dining activities. Surrounding this are the Seating Areas, which include metal frame chairs to provide seating for diners. The Lighting Area is defined by the hanging metal light fixture, which enhances the ambiance and provides necessary illumination. Additionally, a Storage Area is designated for a sideboard to store dining essentials, and a Rug Area is included to define the dining space and enhance the industrial aesthetic.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Dining Table Area, a long wooden table with dimensions of 3.0 meters by 1.0 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended, embodying the industrial style. The Seating Areas are complemented by six metal frame chairs, each measuring 0.557 meters by 0.617 meters by 0.931 meters, to provide ample seating around the table. The Lighting Area features a hanging metal light fixture with dimensions of 1.0 meter by 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters, positioned to illuminate the dining table. The Storage Area includes a sideboard measuring 1.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.9 meters, placed against the north wall for easy access. Finally, a rug measuring 3.0 meters by 2.0 meters is recommended to define the dining area and enhance the room's industrial aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The long wooden dining table is centrally located in the room, serving as the main focus of the dining area. Its dimensions (3.0m x 1.0m x 0.75m) fit well within the 5.0m x 5.0m room, allowing for the placement of chairs and a hanging light fixture. The table is oriented parallel to the walls, facing the north wall, which aligns with typical dining room setups and leaves ample space on either side for chairs. This central placement ensures the table remains the focal point, adhering to industrial design principles while maintaining balance and proportion.

Chair_1, a metal-framed chair, is placed to the left of the table, facing the east wall. This placement ensures no spatial conflicts with the table and provides easy access for seating. Chair_2 is positioned to the right of the table, facing the west wall, creating a balanced and symmetrical arrangement. Chair_3 is placed in front of the table, facing the south wall, while Chair_4 is behind the table, facing the north wall. Chairs 5 and 6 are placed adjacent to Chairs 3 and 4, respectively, maintaining symmetry and balance in the seating arrangement.

The hanging metal light fixture is placed directly above the dining table, suspended from the ceiling. This placement ensures the light is evenly distributed over the table, enhancing the dining experience and maintaining design symmetry. The sideboard is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, providing convenient storage access without obstructing movement. Finally, the rug is placed on the floor beneath the table, extending slightly beyond the chairs to define the dining area. Its color and material complement the industrial style, enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal and functionality.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects fit within the room dimensions without obstructing pathways or overlapping with each other. The arrangement aligns with the user's industrial style preference and adheres to design principles of balance, symmetry, and functionality.
