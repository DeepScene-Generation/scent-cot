## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a functional mudroom that incorporates a white wooden storage bench, metal hooks for coats, and a woven basket for shoes. The room's dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes a cohesive aesthetic with white and metal tones, alongside practical elements such as seating for changing shoes, storage for shoes, and coat hanging. Additional elements like a mirror, floor mat, shoe rack, wall-mounted shelf, and a potted plant are suggested to enhance both functionality and aesthetics, creating a welcoming and organized space.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The mudroom is divided into several functional substructures based on user requirements. The Seating and Storage Area is centered around the storage bench, providing a place for shoe changing and storage. The Coat Hanging Area is designated for the coat hooks, ensuring easy access for hanging outerwear. The Shoe Storage Area includes the woven basket and shoe rack, maintaining organization. The Decorative and Aesthetic Area features the mirror and potted plant, enhancing the room's visual appeal. Lastly, the Entry Protection Area is defined by the floor mat, ensuring cleanliness and adding texture.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating and Storage Area, a rustic white wooden storage bench (1.2m x 0.4m x 0.5m) is recommended. The Coat Hanging Area features modern metal coat hooks (0.8m x 0.05m x 0.1m) in silver. The Shoe Storage Area includes a woven basket (0.343m x 0.264m x 0.165m) and a modern black metal shoe rack (0.8m x 0.3m x 0.5m). The Decorative and Aesthetic Area is enhanced by a modern silver glass mirror (0.6m x 0.02m x 1.0m) and a modern ceramic potted plant (0.229m x 0.177m x 0.224m). The Entry Protection Area is defined by a modern grey fabric floor mat (0.9m x 0.6m x 0.02m).

## 4. Scene Graph
The storage bench is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, as it serves as a central feature for seating and storage. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.4m x 0.5m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing the room's functionality. This placement aligns with the user's preference for a functional mudroom, providing easy access for seating and storage.

The coat hooks are mounted on the south wall above the storage bench, facing the north wall. This placement ensures they are accessible for hanging coats and complements the rustic style of the bench. The hooks' modern style introduces a contemporary contrast, enhancing the aesthetic appeal.

The woven basket is placed under the storage bench, slightly to the left of the center. Its size (0.343m x 0.264m x 0.165m) allows it to fit without obstructing seating or storage functionality, maintaining a cohesive aesthetic with the bench.

The mirror is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, right of the coat hooks. Its vertical orientation complements the horizontal alignment of the bench and basket, enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic without spatial conflicts.

The floor mat is positioned on the floor in front of the storage bench, facing the north wall. This placement provides a practical area for shoe removal and entry protection, aligning with the user's preferences for functionality and enhancing the room's aesthetic.

The shoe rack is placed to the right of the storage bench on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.3m x 0.5m) ensure it fits without obstructing the walkway or the bench's function, maintaining a cohesive mudroom layout.

The wall shelf is mounted on the south wall above the coat hooks, facing the north wall. It provides additional storage and display space, enhancing the room's functionality and maintaining a clean, cohesive look.

The potted plant is placed on the wall shelf, facing the north wall. This placement adds a decorative and fresh element to the room, complementing the existing rustic and modern styles without interfering with the primary functions of the mudroom.

## 5. Global Check
There were no conflicts identified during the placement process. All objects were placed considering spatial constraints and user preferences, ensuring a functional and aesthetically pleasing mudroom layout.
