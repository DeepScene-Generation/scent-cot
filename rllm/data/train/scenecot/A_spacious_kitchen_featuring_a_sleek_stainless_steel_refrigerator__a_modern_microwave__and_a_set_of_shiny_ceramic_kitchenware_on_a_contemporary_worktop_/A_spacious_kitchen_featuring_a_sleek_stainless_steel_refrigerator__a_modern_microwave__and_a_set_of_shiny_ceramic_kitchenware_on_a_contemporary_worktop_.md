## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern and spacious kitchen equipped with essential appliances such as a stainless steel refrigerator, a microwave, and a set of ceramic kitchenware on a worktop. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for additional items that enhance both functionality and aesthetics. The user prefers a sleek, contemporary style, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a cohesive color scheme and balance with the existing stainless steel and ceramic materials.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The kitchen is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The South Wall Area is designated for major appliances like the refrigerator and microwave. The East Wall Area is intended for the worktop and kitchenware display. The Central Area is reserved for dining and social interaction, featuring a dining table and chairs. Additionally, a Kitchen Island Area is proposed to serve as a multifunctional element, offering extra preparation space and seating.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the South Wall Area, a modern stainless steel refrigerator (0.9m x 0.7m x 2.0m) and a microwave (0.6m x 0.4m x 0.35m) are recommended to meet the user's functional needs. The East Wall Area features a contemporary worktop for displaying ceramic kitchenware. In the Central Area, a modern glass dining table (1.5m x 0.9m x 0.75m) with matching metal chairs (0.557m x 0.617m x 0.931m) is suggested to enhance the room's aesthetic and provide a space for casual meals. A modern kitchen island (1.2m x 0.8m x 0.9m) with a bar stool (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.0m) is recommended to offer additional preparation space and seating.

## 4. Scene Graph
The refrigerator is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures it is both functional and aesthetically pleasing, adhering to the user's vision of a modern, spacious kitchen. The refrigerator's dimensions (0.9m x 0.7m x 2.0m) fit comfortably without obstructing movement, and its placement against the wall allows for efficient use of space and utility connections.

The microwave is placed on the worktop adjacent to the refrigerator on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures easy access for quick meal preparation and aligns with the user's vision of a contemporary kitchen. The microwave's dimensions (0.6m x 0.4m x 0.35m) fit well on the worktop, maintaining balance and proportion with the refrigerator.

The dining table is centrally placed in the room, facing the north wall. This placement ensures it does not obstruct movement or usage of other kitchen elements, maintaining the room's spacious and modern ambiance. The table's dimensions (1.5m x 0.9m x 0.75m) allow it to fit comfortably in the middle of the room, enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal.

Chair_1 is placed in front of the dining table, facing the south wall, while Chair_2 is placed behind the dining table, facing the north wall. This symmetrical arrangement provides functional seating and maintains the room's balance and functionality. Both chairs have dimensions of 0.557m x 0.617m x 0.931m, fitting comfortably in the allocated space.

The kitchen island is placed in the middle of the room, slightly towards the north side, facing the north wall. This placement avoids direct conflict with the dining table and chairs, offering additional preparation space and seating while maintaining a spacious feel. The island's dimensions (1.2m x 0.8m x 0.9m) ensure it is easily accessible from the dining table and worktop.

The bar stool is placed adjacent to the kitchen island, facing the north wall. It is positioned right of the kitchen island, ensuring it is easily accessible and functional within the kitchen layout. The stool's dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.0m) fit comfortably next to the kitchen island without interfering with other objects.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified regarding the placement of the worktop and kitchen utensils set. The width of the refrigerator was too small to accommodate the worktop left of it, leading to a spatial conflict. To resolve this, the worktop and kitchen utensils set were removed, as they were deemed less critical compared to the refrigerator and other essential kitchen elements. This decision aligns with the user's preference for a spacious kitchen featuring a sleek stainless steel refrigerator and modern appliances.
