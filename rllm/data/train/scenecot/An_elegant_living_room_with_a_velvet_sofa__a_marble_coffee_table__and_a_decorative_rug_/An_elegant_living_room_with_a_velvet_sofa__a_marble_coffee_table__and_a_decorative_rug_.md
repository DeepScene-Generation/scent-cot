## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions an elegant living room characterized by a velvet sofa, a marble coffee table, and a decorative rug, suggesting a luxurious and cohesive design scheme. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user desires a sophisticated atmosphere, enhanced by ambient lighting from a chandelier, and functional elements like a side table and decorative accessories such as cushions and vases to complement the main furniture pieces.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Seating Area is defined by the placement of the velvet sofa against the south wall, creating a dedicated space for social gatherings and relaxation. The Central Area is marked by the marble coffee table and decorative rug, serving as the focal point for interaction and visual cohesion. The Lighting Area is enhanced by a chandelier centrally mounted on the ceiling, providing ambient lighting. Additional substructures include the Side Table Area next to the sofa for increased functionality and the Decorative Area, which includes accessories like cushions and vases to enhance the room's aesthetic appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a royal blue velvet sofa with dimensions of 2.2 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.9 meters is recommended, serving as a striking centerpiece. The Central Area features a white marble coffee table (1.2 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.4 meters) and a multicolor wool rug (3.0 meters by 2.0 meters by 0.01 meters) to tie the space together. The Lighting Area includes a classic crystal chandelier (0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.7 meters) to enhance the elegant atmosphere. A dark brown wooden side table (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.6 meters) is suggested for the Side Table Area, while golden velvet cushions (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters) and a white ceramic vase (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.5 meters) are recommended for the Decorative Area.

## 4. Scene Graph
The velvet sofa is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, serving as the focal point of the room. Its placement maximizes space efficiency and provides a balanced aesthetic, aligning with the user's preference for an elegant living room. The sofa's dimensions (2.2m x 1.0m x 0.9m) fit comfortably against the wall, allowing ample space for the coffee table and rug in front, creating a comfortable seating area.

The marble coffee table is positioned in front of the sofa, centrally located in the room. This placement supports activities such as reading and relaxing, maintaining visual cohesion with high-quality materials. The coffee table's dimensions (1.2m x 0.8m x 0.4m) fit well within the room, leaving enough space for comfortable circulation and adhering to the design principle of balance.

The decorative rug is placed under the coffee table in the middle of the room, enhancing visual harmony and tying the room together. Its size (3.0m x 2.0m x 0.01m) is appropriate for the room, providing a cohesive and inviting central focus. The rug's intricate patterns add to the room's aesthetic appeal, aligning with the user's vision for an elegant living room.

The chandelier is mounted on the ceiling, centrally located to provide warm lighting and enhance the sophisticated atmosphere. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.8m x 0.7m) allow it to fit comfortably without overwhelming the room's ceiling height, ensuring even light distribution across the room.

The side table is placed to the right of the sofa, adjacent to it, on the south wall. This placement ensures accessibility from the sofa, enhancing functionality while maintaining balance and proportion. The side table's dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.6m) fit comfortably beside the sofa without creating spatial conflicts.

Cushion_1 and Cushion_2 are placed on the sofa, enhancing comfort and aesthetic appeal. Their golden color contrasts elegantly with the royal blue sofa, adding texture and color variation. Each cushion's size (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m) is suitable for placement on the sofa without overcrowding it, maintaining balance and proportion.

The vase is placed on the marble coffee table, centrally located in front of the sofa. Its elegant style and white color complement the existing elements of the room, enhancing the overall aesthetic appeal. The vase's dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.5m) allow it to fit comfortably on the coffee table without interfering with its functionality.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed in a manner that aligns with the user's vision for an elegant living room, adhering to design principles of balance, proportion, and functionality. The room's layout effectively accommodates all recommended objects, ensuring a cohesive and inviting atmosphere.
