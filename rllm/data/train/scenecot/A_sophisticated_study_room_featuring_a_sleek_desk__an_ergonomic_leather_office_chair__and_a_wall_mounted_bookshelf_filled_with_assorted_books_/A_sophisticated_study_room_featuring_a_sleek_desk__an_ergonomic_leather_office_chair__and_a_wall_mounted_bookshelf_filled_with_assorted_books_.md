## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a sophisticated study room characterized by a sleek desk, an ergonomic leather office chair, and a wall-mounted bookshelf. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for a functional and aesthetically pleasing layout. The user's preferences emphasize a modern and elegant theme, with a focus on functionality and minimalism. Additional elements such as a desk lamp, rug, modern clock, side table, and decorative plants are suggested to enhance the room's ambiance and utility, while maintaining a limit of 10 objects to prevent clutter.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Desk Area is designated for the workspace, featuring the desk and office chair. The Bookshelf Area is intended for book storage, utilizing a wall-mounted bookshelf. The Central Open Space is defined by a rug, providing a cohesive area for the workspace. Additional substructures include the Lighting Area, featuring a desk lamp for task lighting, and the Decorative Area, which includes a modern clock, side table, and plant to enhance the room's aesthetic and functionality.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Desk Area, a modern black wooden desk (1.8m x 0.8m x 0.75m) and a brown leather ergonomic office chair (0.7m x 0.7m x 1.2m) are recommended to create a functional and stylish workspace. The Bookshelf Area features a white wooden wall-mounted bookshelf (2.0m x 0.3m x 2.0m) for efficient book storage. A grey wool rug (2.5m x 2.5m) defines the Central Open Space, adding warmth and cohesion. The Lighting Area includes a contemporary silver metal desk lamp (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) for focused illumination. The Decorative Area is enhanced by a black metal wall clock (0.4m x 0.05m x 0.4m), a brown wooden side table (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.6m), and a green ceramic plant (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) to introduce natural elements and personal touches.

## 4. Scene Graph
The desk is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, to maximize functionality and aesthetic appeal. Its dimensions (1.8m x 0.8m x 0.75m) fit well within the room, providing a balanced and organized workspace. This placement ensures the desk remains the focal point, aligning with the user's vision for a sophisticated study room.

The office chair is positioned directly in front of the desk, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.7m x 0.7m x 1.2m) allow it to fit comfortably, adhering to ergonomic principles and maintaining a modern look. This placement ensures easy access to the desk, enhancing functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The bookshelf is mounted on the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.3m x 2.0m) allow it to store books efficiently without occupying floor space. This placement maintains balance and complements the desk's position, creating a cohesive modern look.

The desk lamp is placed on the right side of the desk, facing the south wall. Its small dimensions (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) ensure it fits comfortably without obstructing the workspace. This placement provides optimal lighting for study activities, enhancing functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The rug is placed in the middle of the floor, defining the central workspace. Its dimensions (2.5m x 2.5m) allow it to unify the desk and chair visually, enhancing the room's overall aesthetic and functionality without causing spatial conflicts.

The clock is mounted on the west wall, ensuring visibility from the desk area. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.05m x 0.4m) complement the modern theme and colors used within the room. This placement provides functionality and maintains the room's modern aesthetic.

The side table is placed to the left of the office chair, facing the east wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.6m) ensure it fits within the available space without obstructing pathways. This placement provides an additional surface for items, enhancing the room's functionality and sophisticated ambiance.

The plant is placed right of the side table, adjacent to it. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) ensure it fits comfortably, adding a decorative element without compromising space or functionality. This placement enhances the room's decor, complementing the modern style.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects fit within the room's dimensions and adhere to the user's preferences for a sophisticated study room. The placement of each object maintains balance, functionality, and aesthetic appeal, ensuring a cohesive and visually pleasing environment.
