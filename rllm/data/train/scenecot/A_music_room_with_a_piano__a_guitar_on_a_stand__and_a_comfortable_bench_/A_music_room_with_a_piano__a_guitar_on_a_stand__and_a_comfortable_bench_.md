## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a music room that incorporates a piano, a guitar on a stand, and a comfortable bench as the primary elements. The room is designed to facilitate musical activities, with specific areas designated for the piano, guitar, seating, and open movement space. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for these elements. The user emphasizes the need for functional and aesthetic harmony, ensuring that each object contributes to the room's purpose as a music space.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The music room is divided into several key substructures based on the user's requirements. The Piano Area is designated for the piano and includes appropriate lighting to enhance the instrument's presence. The Guitar Area is intended for the guitar and its stand, with a spotlight to emphasize this section. The Seating Area features a comfortable bench for practice or relaxation, accompanied by a side table for accessories. Lastly, the Open Movement Space is designed to remain unobstructed, encouraging free movement and creativity within the room.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Piano Area, a classic-style wooden piano measuring 1.5 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.2 meters is recommended, along with a modern brass piano light to illuminate the area. The Guitar Area includes a contemporary-style guitar with dimensions of 0.4 meters by 0.1 meters by 1.0 meters, placed on a stand for stability. The Seating Area features a classic-style bench made of fabric and wood, measuring 1.2 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.5 meters, providing comfort and functionality. A classic-style wooden side table was initially recommended but later removed due to spatial constraints.

## 4. Scene Graph
The piano, a central element of the music room, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This location allows the player to face the room, creating an inviting atmosphere and ensuring optimal sound distribution. The piano's dimensions (1.5m x 0.6m x 1.2m) fit well against the wall, leaving sufficient space for the bench and other musical elements. The piano light is installed on the ceiling directly above the piano, providing effective illumination without occupying floor or wall space, enhancing the piano-playing experience.

The guitar is positioned against the east wall, facing the west wall, in the southeast corner of the room. This placement ensures accessibility and visual coherence with the room's musical theme. The guitar's dimensions (0.4m x 0.1m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing movement. The guitar stand, initially placed adjacent to the guitar, was removed due to spatial constraints, ensuring the room remains functional and aesthetically pleasing.

The bench is placed in front of the piano, facing the north wall. This positioning allows easy access during practice or performances, maintaining balance and proportion within the room. The bench's dimensions (1.2m x 0.4m x 0.5m) ensure it fits comfortably without blocking access. The side table, initially intended to be placed to the left of the bench, was removed to maintain an unobstructed flow of movement and adhere to the user's preference for a functional music room.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to spatial constraints. The bench's width was insufficient to accommodate the side table, and the guitar's width could not accommodate the guitar stand. To resolve these conflicts, the side table and guitar stand were removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a music room with a piano, guitar, and comfortable bench. This resolution ensures the room remains functional and aesthetically aligned with the user's vision.
