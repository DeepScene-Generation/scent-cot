## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a home gym that includes a treadmill and a weight rack, emphasizing a well-equipped space for both cardio and strength training. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for these essential gym items and additional equipment. The user also prioritizes durable flooring to support heavy equipment and prefers a setup that allows for open space in the middle of the room for floor exercises. Proper ventilation and lighting are important for comfort and safety, suggesting the inclusion of a fan or air purifier. A mirror is considered to enhance the perception of space and allow users to check their form during workouts. Additional items like a yoga mat and storage solutions are suggested to enhance functionality and convenience.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional areas based on the user's requirements. The South Wall Area is designated for the treadmill and weight rack, providing a dedicated zone for cardio and strength training. The Middle Area is reserved for floor exercises, ensuring it remains clear for free movement. The North Wall Area is intended for ventilation equipment, such as a fan, to maintain airflow. The East Wall Area is allocated for a mirror to enhance visual space and functionality. The entire floor is covered with rubber flooring to protect against equipment damage and reduce noise.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the South Wall Area, a modern treadmill (2.0m x 0.8m x 1.5m) and a compact weight rack (1.2m x 0.5m x 1.2m) are recommended to fulfill the user's cardio and strength training needs. Rubber flooring (5.0m x 5.0m) is suggested to cover the entire floor, providing safety and noise reduction. A modern fan (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.0m) is recommended for the North Wall Area to ensure proper ventilation. A minimalist mirror (1.5m x 0.05m x 2.0m) is proposed for the East Wall to enhance the room's visual space. A minimalist yoga mat (1.8m x 0.6m) is suggested for the Middle Area to facilitate floor exercises.

## 4. Scene Graph
The treadmill is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, as it is a significant object requiring stability and open space for safe use. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.8m x 1.5m) fit well along the wall, maximizing floor space and ensuring accessibility. This placement aligns with the user's vision of a well-equipped gym, maintaining balance and proportion by freeing up the rest of the room.

The weight rack is positioned to the right of the treadmill on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures easy access to weights during workouts and maintains an organized appearance. The weight rack's compact size (1.2m x 0.5m x 1.2m) allows it to fit comfortably alongside the treadmill, optimizing the south wall's use without obstructing movement.

Rubber flooring covers the entire room (5.0m x 5.0m), providing a protective layer that enhances safety and reduces noise. This placement does not interfere with other objects and aligns with the user's preference for a well-equipped gym, maintaining a cohesive and visually appealing environment.

The fan is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, to ensure efficient airflow towards the treadmill and weight rack. Its compact size (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.0m) allows it to integrate seamlessly into the gym's layout, enhancing comfort during workouts without occupying much floor space.

The mirror is installed on the east wall, facing the west wall, to enhance the gym's functionality by providing visual feedback during workouts. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.05m x 2.0m) ensure it does not interfere with other objects, increasing perceived space and brightness in the room.

The yoga mat is placed in the middle of the room, oriented parallel to the longer walls (north and south) to maximize usable space. Its dimensions (1.8m x 0.6m) allow for free movement around it, facilitating floor exercises without obstructing access to other equipment.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to the limited space on the south wall, which could not accommodate all intended objects, including the exercise bench and storage basket. To resolve this, the exercise bench and storage basket were removed, as they were deemed less critical compared to the treadmill and weight rack, which are essential for the user's cardio and strength training needs. This decision ensured the room remained functional and aligned with the user's preference for a well-equipped gym.
