## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a boutique walk-in closet with dimensions of 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters by 3.0 meters, emphasizing elegance and functionality. Key elements include an island dresser and a crystal chandelier, with a focus on organizing wardrobe items, displaying accessories, and providing storage for shoes and bags. The closet should reflect a luxurious aesthetic while maintaining practicality, ensuring that all items are easily accessible and the space remains uncluttered.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional areas: the south wall is designated for wardrobe organization with shelves and racks, while the central area features the island dresser and chandelier as focal points. The north wall is reserved for a full-length mirror, and the east and west walls provide additional storage for shoes and bags. This decomposition ensures that each area serves a specific purpose, contributing to the overall functionality and aesthetic of the closet.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central area, a luxurious island dresser (1.5m x 1.0m x 0.9m) is recommended, paired with an elegant crystal chandelier (0.8m x 0.8m x 1.0m) to enhance the room's opulence. The south wall features modern wooden shelves (2.0m x 0.3m x 2.0m) for wardrobe organization. A sleek silver-framed mirror (0.8m x 0.05m x 2.0m) is placed on the north wall for appearance checks. The east wall accommodates modern metal racks (2.0m x 0.3m x 2.0m) for additional storage, while the west wall holds a modern wooden storage unit (1.5m x 0.5m x 2.0m) for shoes and bags. A navy blue velvet stool (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.5m) provides convenient seating near the dresser, and a decorative vase (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) adds a touch of luxury.

## 4. Scene Graph
The island dresser is the central feature of the closet, placed in the middle of the room to allow easy access from all sides, making it a focal point. Its dimensions (1.5m x 1.0m x 0.9m) fit well within the room's size, ensuring balance and symmetry. The dresser faces the north wall, with a crystal chandelier hanging above it, enhancing the luxurious feel and providing balanced illumination.

The chandelier, measuring 0.8m x 0.8m x 1.0m, is centrally placed above the island dresser to provide optimal lighting and emphasize the room's elegance. This placement ensures no spatial conflicts and aligns with the user's vision for a boutique walk-in closet.

Modern wooden shelves (2.0m x 0.3m x 2.0m) are placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. This location optimizes wardrobe organization and complements the luxurious style of the island dresser and chandelier, maintaining balance and functionality.

Racks made of modern metal (2.0m x 0.3m x 2.0m) are positioned on the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement maintains visual balance with the shelves on the south wall and ensures a clear path through the room, enhancing functionality without spatial conflicts.

A sleek silver-framed mirror (0.8m x 0.05m x 2.0m) is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. This location allows users to step back and have a clear view, enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic balance.

The modern wooden storage unit (1.5m x 0.5m x 2.0m) is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement is accessible and complements the existing furniture arrangement, maintaining an open floor space and aligning with the user's vision of a boutique walk-in closet.

A navy blue velvet stool (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.5m) is placed adjacent to the island dresser, facing the north wall. This position allows for easy access to storage and maintains an open flow in the room, enhancing both aesthetic and functional appeal.

The decorative vase (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) is placed on the island dresser, centered under the chandelier. This placement ensures it becomes a focal point, enhancing the room's luxurious theme and visual appeal.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the placement of 'storage_unit_2' on the east wall, as its width was too small to accommodate it alongside 'racks_1'. To resolve this, 'storage_unit_2' was removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a boutique walk-in closet with an island dresser and a crystal chandelier. This decision maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic, ensuring a harmonious and uncluttered space.

            - Cluster size (on): max(0.0, 1.5) = 1.5
        - conclusion: storage_unit_1 cluster size (on): 1.5
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'west_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - storage_unit_1 size: length=1.5, width=0.5, height=2.0
            - Room size: 5.0x5.0x3.0
            - x_min = x_max = 0.25
            - y_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 1.5/2 = 0.75
            - y_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 1.5/2 = 4.25
            - z_min = z_max = 2.0/2 = 1.0
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.25, 0.25, 0.75, 4.25, 1.0, 1.0)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.25-0.25), y(0.75-4.25)
            - Final coordinates: x=0.25, y=4.073545041913244, z=1.0
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.25, y: 4.073545041913244, z: 1.0
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=0.25, y=4.073545041913244, z=1.0
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.25, y: 4.073545041913244, z: 1.0
