## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a vibrant playroom for children, emphasizing a lively and engaging atmosphere. Key elements include a colorful rug, a wooden toy chest, and bean bags, with a focus on safe materials and cheerful colors. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design aims to create an open space conducive to play activities, incorporating functional and aesthetic elements that do not exceed 15 items.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The playroom is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Wooden Toy Chest Area is designated for toy storage, ensuring easy access for children. The Seating Area, featuring bean bags, provides a comfortable space for relaxation and interaction. The Play Area, defined by a colorful rug, serves as the central zone for activities. Additional substructures include a Child Table and Chairs Area for crafts and play, a Wall Decals Area for visual stimulation, a Soft Lighting Area for ambient illumination, a Small Shelf Area for books or toys, and a Play Tent Area for imaginative play.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Wooden Toy Chest Area, a traditional wooden toy chest (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.8m) is recommended for storage. The Seating Area includes three modern bean bags in red, blue, and green, each measuring 0.8m x 0.8m x 0.6m. The Play Area features a colorful rug (3.0m x 3.0m) to define the central play zone. The Child Table and Chairs Area includes a modern yellow table (1.0m x 0.6m x 0.5m) with two chairs in orange and purple, each 0.4m x 0.4m x 0.6m. Wall decals add visual interest to the north wall, while a soft lighting fixture (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.5m) provides ambient light from the ceiling. A small white shelf (0.8m x 0.3m x 1.0m) offers additional storage on the east wall, and a pink play tent (1.2m x 1.2m x 1.5m) encourages imaginative play.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden toy chest is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to maximize accessibility and maintain an open area in the center of the room. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.8m) ensure it does not obstruct pathways, aligning with the user's vision of a vibrant playroom. The bean bags are arranged in the middle of the room, with the red bean bag centrally located, the blue bean bag to its right, and the green bean bag to its left. This arrangement forms a cozy seating area around the colorful rug, promoting interaction and maintaining an open play space. The colorful rug, measuring 3.0m x 3.0m, is centrally placed, with the bean bags slightly adjusted to sit on it, enhancing the cohesiveness of the play area.

The child table is positioned on the east side of the colorful rug, facing the west wall, ensuring it is part of the central play area without interfering with the bean bags. The orange child chair is placed to the right of the table, and the purple chair to the left, both facing the table to encourage interaction. Wall decals are applied to the north wall, adding vibrancy without occupying floor space. The soft lighting fixture is centrally mounted on the ceiling, providing even illumination throughout the room. The small shelf is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, offering storage without disrupting the open play area. The play tent is positioned slightly to the east side of the play area, facing the north wall, ensuring it is part of the central play zone while keeping the area open and inviting.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were positioned to avoid spatial conflicts, ensuring the room remains open and functional. The arrangement aligns with the user's preferences for a vibrant and interactive playroom, adhering to design principles of balance and proportion.
