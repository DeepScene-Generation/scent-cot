## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions an artist's studio within a square room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The studio is to be equipped with essential elements such as a wooden easel, paintbrushes, and a canvas, reflecting both functionality and aesthetic appeal. The user desires a space that facilitates artistic creation and showcases finished artworks, with natural light playing a significant role. Additional implicit needs include seating for the artist and storage solutions for art materials, all while maintaining a maximum of 13 objects to ensure a clutter-free environment.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The studio is divided into several functional substructures. The Easel Area is dedicated to painting activities, requiring a sturdy easel and appropriately sized canvas. The Paintbrush Organization Area features a small table for organizing and storing paintbrushes and materials. The Open Central Area is designed for movement and viewing artwork, potentially enhanced by a comfortable rug. The Display Area on the south wall is intended for showcasing finished artworks using a modern hanging system. The Window on the east wall provides natural light, and additional seating and storage solutions are considered to support the artist's workflow.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Easel Area, a classic wooden easel is recommended to hold the canvas for painting. The Paintbrush Organization Area includes a modern wooden table to organize paintbrushes. A minimalist paintbrush set is suggested for the table. The Open Central Area is defined by a bohemian-style rug to enhance comfort and aesthetics. The Display Area features a contemporary metal hanging system for artwork. An industrial-style stool provides seating, while a modern storage cabinet offers a solution for storing art materials, ensuring the studio remains organized and functional.

## 4. Scene Graph
The easel, a fundamental piece for the artist's studio, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures stability and optimal lighting conditions from the window, allowing the artist ample space to move around. The easel's dimensions are 0.7 meters in length, 0.6 meters in width, and 1.8 meters in height, making it a prominent feature in the studio.

The table, intended for organizing paintbrushes, is positioned on the south wall to the right of the easel, facing the north wall. Its dimensions are 0.8 meters in length, 0.5 meters in width, and 0.75 meters in height. This placement ensures easy access to painting materials without obstructing the easel or canvas.

The paintbrush set is placed on the table, ensuring it is within arm's reach of the easel and canvas. The set's small size (0.3 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.02 meters) allows it to fit comfortably on the table, maintaining an organized workspace.

The rug, measuring 2.0 meters by 2.0 meters, is placed in the middle of the room. This central placement defines the space without interfering with other objects, adding a vibrant aesthetic to the studio with its multicolor bohemian style.

The hanging system, 4.0 meters in length, is installed on the south wall above the easel and table. This placement utilizes vertical space efficiently, allowing for the display of artwork at eye level without obstructing the functionality of the easel and table.

The stool, measuring 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.5 meters, is placed to the left of the easel, facing the north wall. This ensures easy access to both the easel and table, supporting the artist's comfort and efficiency.

The storage cabinet, with dimensions of 1.0 meter by 0.4 meters by 1.5 meters, is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement provides easy access to stored materials while maintaining a clear workspace, complementing the studio's modern aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose regarding the placement of the canvas on the easel, as the area was too small to accommodate all objects. To resolve this, the canvas was removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a functional artist's studio with a wooden easel and paintbrushes. This decision ensures the studio remains organized and functional, aligning with the user's artistic vision.
