## 4. Scene Graph
The farmhouse sink is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, serving as a central feature in the rustic kitchen. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.6m x 0.3m) fit well against the wall, providing balance and symmetry. This placement allows for ease of access and usability, aligning with user preferences and design principles.

The wooden cutting board is placed on a countertop adjacent to the farmhouse sink, ensuring easy access for food preparation. Its small, flat dimensions (0.469m x 0.299m x 0.022m) allow it to complement the sink without interfering with other items, maintaining the rustic aesthetic and functional layout.

The iron pot rack is mounted on the ceiling, centrally positioned in the room above the imaginary stove. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.4m x 0.1m) ensure it does not interfere with the farmhouse sink or cutting board, providing a focal point and maintaining the rustic theme.

The stove is placed on the south wall, under the iron pot rack, and to the left of the farmhouse sink. It faces the north wall, ensuring a functional kitchen layout while adhering to the rustic theme. This placement maintains balance and proportion, providing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The pot storage is placed on the south wall, right of the stove, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.5m x 0.7m) ensure it is adjacent to the stove, providing functional access and maintaining the rustic theme.

The rustic table is centrally placed in the middle of the room, facing the ceiling. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.9m x 0.75m) allow for easy access and movement around the table, enhancing functionality for dining purposes and providing visual balance.

Rustic chair 1 is placed in front of the rustic table, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.9m) ensure it complements the table without causing spatial conflicts, providing functional seating and enhancing the rustic aesthetic.

Rustic chair 2 is placed behind the rustic table, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.9m) ensure it complements the existing seating arrangement, maintaining balance and symmetry within the dining setup.

The lighting fixture is placed on the ceiling, centrally above the rustic table. Its dimensions (0.161m x 0.161m x 0.776m) ensure it provides balanced lighting and complements the room's symmetry, enhancing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The fruit bowl is placed on the rustic table, serving as a decorative centerpiece. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.15m) ensure it fits comfortably on the table, enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the rustic table and maintaining the rustic theme.

The wall art is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.6m) ensure it serves as a decorative element, enhancing the rustic charm of the kitchen without interfering with functionality.
