## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user has described a mudroom with a focus on functionality, emphasizing the need for a wooden storage bench, coat hooks, and a durable doormat. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user prefers a rustic aesthetic, with additional functional elements such as a shoe rack, umbrella stand, mirror, wall-mounted key holder, boot tray, small potted plant, and decorative wall clock to enhance the room's utility and welcoming feel.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional zones based on the user's requirements. The Storage Area is designated for the wooden storage bench, which serves as both seating and storage. The Hanging Area is for coat hooks, providing a convenient spot for outerwear. The Entrance Area includes the doormat and boot tray to manage dirt and moisture. The Shoe Storage Area is for the shoe rack, ensuring organization. The Umbrella Stand Area is for holding umbrellas, while the Mirror and Key Holder Area is for personal checks and key storage. Lastly, the Decorative Area includes a potted plant and wall clock to enhance the room's aesthetic.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Storage Area, a rustic wooden storage bench measuring 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters is recommended. The Hanging Area features industrial-style coat hooks (0.585 meters by 0.128 meters by 0.914 meters) for hanging coats. The Entrance Area includes a minimalist dark grey doormat (1.2 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.02 meters) and a modern black boot tray (0.9 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.05 meters). The Shoe Storage Area has a modern black shoe rack (0.8 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.6 meters). The Umbrella Stand Area includes a contemporary silver umbrella stand (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.6 meters). The Mirror and Key Holder Area features a classic mirror and rustic key holder, though these were removed due to spatial conflicts. The Decorative Area includes a bohemian-style potted plant (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.6 meters) and a vintage bronze wall clock (0.4 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.4 meters).

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden storage bench is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures stability and maximizes central floor space, aligning with the user's preference for a functional mudroom. The bench's natural wood color complements the rustic style, providing both seating and storage immediately upon entry. The coat hooks are positioned above the storage bench on the south wall, ensuring easy access and maintaining a cohesive look. Their industrial style and black color contrast nicely with the rustic bench, adding aesthetic appeal. The doormat is placed on the floor in front of the storage bench, facing the entrance area. Its compact size allows it to fit comfortably without obstructing movement, effectively trapping dirt and moisture. The shoe rack is placed on the south wall to the left of the storage bench, ensuring accessibility and organization. Its modern black design matches the coat hooks, creating visual cohesion. The umbrella stand is placed on the south wall to the right of the storage bench, maintaining balance and symmetry while keeping the functional area clear. The boot tray is positioned in front of the storage bench, on the floor, facing the north wall. This placement allows it to effectively contain dirt from boots while maintaining balance and functionality. The potted plant is placed on the floor near the right side of the storage bench, to the right of the umbrella stand, adding greenery without obstructing functionality. The wall clock is placed on the south wall, adjacent to the coat hooks, maintaining the vintage aesthetic and functionality without obstructing any other object.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the placement of the mirror and key holder due to insufficient space on the east wall. The width of the coat hooks was too small to accommodate the mirror, leading to the decision to remove both the mirror and key holder. This resolution aligns with the user's preference for a functional mudroom, prioritizing essential elements like the storage bench, coat hooks, and doormat. The removal of these objects ensures the room remains functional and aesthetically pleasing without overcrowding.
