## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a classic living room characterized by essential furniture pieces such as a velvet sofa, a wooden coffee table, and a wrought iron chandelier. These elements are intended to create a luxurious and inviting atmosphere. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for additional elements like side tables, a rug, decorative cushions, and a floor lamp to enhance the room's luxury and comfort without cluttering the space.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to optimize its classic style and functionality. The Seating Area is anchored by the velvet sofa against the south wall, providing a comfortable space for social interaction. The Central Area features the wooden coffee table, facilitating gatherings and serving as a focal point. The Lighting Area is highlighted by the wrought iron chandelier, centrally suspended to illuminate the room effectively. Additional substructures include the Side Table Areas on either side of the sofa for convenience, and the Decorative Area, which includes a rug and decorative items to enhance the room's aesthetic appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a classic velvet sofa in deep blue is recommended, measuring 2.0 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.8 meters. The Central Area features a dark brown wooden coffee table with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.45 meters. The Lighting Area is enhanced by a wrought iron chandelier, measuring 1.0 meter by 1.0 meter by 0.6 meters, providing intricate lighting. Side tables, each measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.6 meters, are recommended for placement on either side of the sofa. A beige wool rug (3.0 meters by 2.0 meters) is suggested for the Decorative Area, along with a gold velvet cushion (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.15 meters) for added comfort. A canvas artwork (1.2 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.8 meters) and a white ceramic decorative bowl (0.084 meters by 0.084 meters by 0.057 meters) are also recommended to enhance the classic decor.

## 4. Scene Graph
The velvet sofa is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, serving as the central seating element. Its placement provides a strong visual anchor and aligns with the user's preference for a classic style. The sofa's dimensions (2.0m x 0.9m x 0.8m) ensure it fits comfortably against the wall, allowing ample space for movement and additional furniture.

The wooden coffee table is centrally positioned in front of the sofa, facing the north wall. This placement ensures it complements the sofa and functions as a central piece, allowing easy access and movement around it. The table's dimensions (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.45m) are proportionate to the room's layout, enhancing balance and functionality.

The wrought iron chandelier is suspended from the ceiling, centrally above the coffee table and sofa. This placement ensures it provides adequate lighting for the central area, enhancing the classic ambiance. The chandelier's dimensions (1.0m x 1.0m x 0.6m) ensure it does not interfere with the height or position of other objects.

Side tables are placed on either side of the sofa, with side_table_1 to the right and side_table_2 to the left, both facing the north wall. Their placement ensures convenient access and maintains balance and proportion in the room's layout. Each side table measures 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.6 meters, fitting comfortably beside the sofa.

The rug is placed under the coffee table, centrally located in the room. It extends in front of the sofa and covers the area up to the side tables, enhancing the overall aesthetic and functionality of the living room. The rug's dimensions (3.0m x 2.0m) ensure it fits well within the space, providing comfort and style.

Cushion_1 is placed on the sofa, providing comfort and visual interest. Its gold color complements the deep blue sofa, enhancing the classic style. The cushion's dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.15m) ensure it fits comfortably without overcrowding the sofa.

The artwork is placed on the south wall above the velvet sofa, facing the north wall. This placement enhances the aesthetic appeal of the room, aligns with the classic style, and creates a balanced visual composition. The artwork's dimensions (1.2m x 0.1m x 0.8m) are proportional to the sofa's length, ensuring a harmonious arrangement.

The decorative bowl is placed on top of the coffee table, in the middle of the room. It is positioned in front of the sofa, enhancing the central living space's decor without disrupting functionality. The bowl's small size (0.084m x 0.084m x 0.057m) ensures it does not occupy much space or interfere with the use of the coffee table.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts were identified due to limited space on the sofa and the south wall. The sofa could not accommodate all three cushions, leading to the removal of cushion_3 and cushion_2 to maintain functionality and user preference for a classic living room. Additionally, the south wall was too small to accommodate all intended objects, resulting in the removal of the floor lamp to prioritize the essential elements of the classic style, such as the velvet sofa, wooden coffee table, and wrought iron chandelier. These adjustments ensured a balanced and harmonious living room while adhering to the user's classic style preferences.
