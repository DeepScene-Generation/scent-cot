## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a classic study room characterized by a leather desk chair, an elegant wooden desk, and a globe on a stand. The room's dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for additional elements. The user emphasizes a warm, inviting atmosphere with traditional styling, focusing on rich materials and classic colors. The room should be both functional and aesthetically pleasing, incorporating elements like a desk lamp, a bookshelf, and a rug to enhance its classic ambiance. The user also desires a maximum of 13 objects to maintain a balance between functionality and aesthetics.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to align with the user's requirements. The central Study Area includes the desk and leather chair, serving as the primary workspace. The Decorative Area features the globe on a stand, enhancing the room's classic ambiance. The Storage Area is designated for the bookcase, providing space for books and maintaining the room's functionality. The Lighting Area includes both the desk lamp and ceiling light, ensuring adequate illumination. Lastly, the Aesthetic Area is defined by the rug and wall art, contributing to the room's visual appeal and classic style.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Study Area, a classic wooden desk (1.8m x 0.8m x 0.75m) and a leather chair (0.7m x 0.7m x 1.2m) are recommended to provide a functional and stylish workspace. The Decorative Area features a globe on a stand (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.2m), adding both aesthetic and educational value. In the Storage Area, a classic wooden bookcase (1.0m x 0.3m x 2.0m) is suggested for storing books. The Lighting Area includes a brass desk lamp (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) and a crystal ceiling light (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.5m) to ensure proper lighting. The Aesthetic Area is enhanced by a wool rug (3.0m x 2.0m) and canvas wall art (1.2m x 0.05m x 0.8m), which tie the room's elements together.

## 4. Scene Graph
The desk, a central element of the study room, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement maximizes space and provides a clear line of sight, aligning with the user's preference for a classic setup. The desk's dimensions (1.8m x 0.8m x 0.75m) fit well within the room, leaving space for additional furniture. The leather chair is positioned in front of the desk, facing the south wall, ensuring functionality for writing and organizing. Its dimensions (0.7m x 0.7m x 1.2m) complement the desk, and its placement maintains the classic aesthetic.

The globe stand is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall, balancing the room's layout. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.2m) allow it to be both decorative and functional without obstructing movement. The desk lamp, with its small footprint (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m), is placed on the desk, providing focused light for tasks. Its brass material complements the room's classic style. The bookcase is positioned against the west wall, facing the east wall, providing storage without interfering with the room's flow. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.3m x 2.0m) ensure stability and easy access to books.

The rug is centrally placed under the desk and chair, enhancing the room's aesthetic by visually tying the furniture together. Its dimensions (3.0m x 2.0m) ensure it does not interfere with other objects. The wall art is placed on the west wall above the bookcase, adding visual interest without blocking functional elements. The ceiling light is centrally mounted, providing even illumination throughout the room. Its crystal material adds elegance, aligning with the user's preference for a classic ambiance.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The room's layout accommodates all objects without spatial conflicts, maintaining the classic aesthetic and functionality. The placement of each object adheres to design principles, ensuring balance, proportion, and accessibility. The room's elements work harmoniously to create a cohesive and inviting classic study environment.
