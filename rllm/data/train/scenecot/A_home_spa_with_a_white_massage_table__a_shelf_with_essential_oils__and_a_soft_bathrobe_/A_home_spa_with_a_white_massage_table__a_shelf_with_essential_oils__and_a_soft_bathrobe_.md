## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a home spa that includes a massage table, a shelf for essential oils, and a bathrobe hook. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters. The user specifies the placement of these items in the middle of the room, along the south wall, and on the east wall. The spa should be functional and aesthetically pleasing, with a focus on relaxation and easy access to spa essentials. The user prefers a modern style, with a white massage table as the centerpiece, complemented by ambient lighting and seating for relaxation.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional areas: the Massage Table Area in the center, the Essential Oil Shelf Area along the south wall, the Relaxation Space near the north wall, and the Bathrobe Hook Area on the north wall. Each area is designed to enhance the spa's functionality and aesthetic, with the massage table serving as the focal point, the shelf providing storage and aromatherapy, and the relaxation space offering seating and ambient lighting.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Massage Table Area, a modern white massage table measuring 2.0 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended. A black metal stool (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.6 meters) complements the table for seating. The Essential Oil Shelf Area features a modern wooden shelf (1.15 meters by 0.398 meters by 2.152 meters) for storage, with a small white diffuser (0.077 meters by 0.087 meters by 0.133 meters) placed on it. The Relaxation Space includes a beige fabric lounge chair (1.5 meters by 0.8 meters by 1.0 meters) and a silver metal floor lamp (0.601 meters by 0.601 meters by 1.902 meters) for ambient lighting. The Bathrobe Hook Area includes a silver metal bathrobe hook and towel hook, each measuring 0.1 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.15 meters.

## 4. Scene Graph
The massage table is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall, to serve as the spa's focal point. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.8m x 0.75m) allow for easy access from all sides, aligning with the user's preference for a functional and balanced layout. The stool is positioned behind the massage table, facing the north wall, providing seating for the masseuse without obstructing movement. Its compact size (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.6m) ensures it fits comfortably in the space.

The essential oil shelf is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to provide convenient storage and enhance the spa's aesthetic. Its dimensions (1.15m x 0.398m x 2.152m) allow it to fit snugly against the wall, maintaining balance and proportion. The diffuser is placed on the shelf, facing the north wall, to enhance the room's aromatherapy capabilities without causing spatial conflicts.

The bathrobe hook is installed on the north wall, facing the south wall, to provide easy access from the massage table. Its small size (0.1m x 0.1m x 0.15m) ensures it does not interfere with other objects. The lounge chair is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall, to create a relaxation zone. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.8m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably in the space, complementing the essential oil shelf. The floor lamp is positioned to the right of the lounge chair, slightly away from the wall, to provide optimal lighting for the relaxation area. Its height (1.902m) ensures it illuminates the space effectively.

The towel hook is placed on the north wall, right of the bathrobe hook, facing the south wall. This placement maintains a coherent hanging area, ensuring easy access from the massage table and lounge chair.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified in the placement of objects within the room. The layout effectively balances functionality and aesthetics, adhering to the user's vision for a modern home spa. All objects are placed to enhance the spa's usability and ambiance, with careful consideration of spatial relationships and design principles.
