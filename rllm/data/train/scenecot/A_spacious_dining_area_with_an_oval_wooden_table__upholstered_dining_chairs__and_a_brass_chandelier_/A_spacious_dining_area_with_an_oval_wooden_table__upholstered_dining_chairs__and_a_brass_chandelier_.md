## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a spacious dining area characterized by an oval wooden table, upholstered dining chairs, and a brass chandelier. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design emphasizes comfort, elegance, and sufficient lighting, with a preference for a classic style that harmonizes with the room's dimensions and layout elements, including the walls and ceiling.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The dining area is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Dining Seating Area is designated for the oval wooden table and upholstered chairs, ensuring functionality and comfort. The Chandelier Lighting Fixture is intended to provide adequate illumination and enhance the room's elegance. The Dining Space Area is designed to allow comfortable movement and serving, with no specific objects required but a focus on the arrangement of furniture to ensure adequate space. Additional elements like a sideboard or buffet table are considered for storage and serving, along with a centerpiece to add visual interest.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Dining Seating Area, a classic-style oval wooden table measuring 2.2 meters by 1.2 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended, accompanied by four upholstered dining chairs, each with dimensions of 0.368 meters by 0.404 meters by 0.837 meters. A vintage brass chandelier with dimensions of 0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 1.0 meters is suggested for the Chandelier Lighting Fixture. A classic wooden sideboard measuring 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.9 meters is proposed for storage and serving purposes. Finally, a contemporary glass centerpiece with dimensions of 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.2 meters is recommended to enhance the dining table's aesthetic appeal.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dining table is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall, to serve as the focal point and facilitate movement and interaction during dining. Its dimensions (2.2m x 1.2m x 0.75m) necessitate a central position to avoid wall congestion and ensure easy movement around it. This placement aligns with the user's preference for a spacious dining area and adheres to design principles by ensuring balance and proportion.

Dining Chair 1 is positioned adjacent to the dining table, facing the south wall. Its compact dimensions (0.368m x 0.404m x 0.837m) allow it to fit around the table without crowding the space, maintaining functionality and the classic aesthetic. Dining Chair 2 is placed behind the dining table, facing the north wall, creating a symmetrical seating arrangement with Dining Chair 1. Dining Chair 3 is positioned to the right of the dining table, facing the west wall, while Dining Chair 4 is placed to the left, facing the east wall. This arrangement ensures balance and symmetry around the table, enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal.

The chandelier is centrally placed above the dining table, attached to the ceiling, ensuring it provides balanced lighting for the dining area. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.8m x 1.0m) fit well above the table, ensuring it does not obstruct views or movement while enhancing the room's elegance. The sideboard is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, utilizing wall space efficiently and maintaining the room's spaciousness. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.5m x 0.9m) ensure it does not interfere with movement around the dining table. The centerpiece is placed on the dining table, providing a decorative focal point that aligns with the user's vision of a spacious and elegantly decorated dining area. Its small size (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.2m) ensures it does not obstruct the view or use of the table.

## 5. Global Check
There are no conflicts detected in the current arrangement. The placement of all objects adheres to the user's preferences and design principles, ensuring a spacious and functional dining area. The arrangement maintains balance and symmetry, with no spatial conflicts or obstructions, fulfilling the user's vision for the dining space.

For sideboard_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No rotation difference calculation needed
        - conclusion: No directional constraint applied
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'south_wall' relation
        - calculation:
            - sideboard_1 size: 1.5 (length)
            - Cluster size (south_wall): max(0.0, 1.5) = 1.5
        - conclusion: sideboard_1 cluster size (south_wall): 1.5
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'south_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - sideboard_1 size: length=1.5, width=0.5, height=0.9
