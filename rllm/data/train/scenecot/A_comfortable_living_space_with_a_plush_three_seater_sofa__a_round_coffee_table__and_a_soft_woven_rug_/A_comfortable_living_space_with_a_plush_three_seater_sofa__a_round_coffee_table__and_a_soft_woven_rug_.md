## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a cozy living space characterized by a plush three-seater sofa, a round coffee table, and a soft woven rug. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, benefits from ample natural light streaming through the east wall. The user's preferences emphasize comfort and aesthetic appeal, with a focus on creating a harmonious and inviting environment.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The Seating Area is centered around the plush three-seater sofa, providing a comfortable space for relaxation. The Coffee Table Area is designed for interaction and accessibility, positioned centrally in front of the sofa. The Woven Rug Area adds warmth and texture, enhancing the room's ambiance. Additionally, an Open Movement Space is maintained to ensure unobstructed flow and interaction within the room.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a modern-style plush three-seater sofa is recommended, emphasizing comfort and spacious seating. The Coffee Table Area features a modern round coffee table that complements the sofa, facilitating interaction and functionality. A soft woven rug with an intricate pattern is suggested to create a warm ambiance and add texture. Additional recommendations include a side table for extra surface space, a set of cushions for added comfort, and a decorative wall art piece to enhance visual appeal.

## 4. Scene Graph
The plush three-seater sofa, a central element of the user's vision, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement maximizes the room's space, allowing for functional seating and maintaining aesthetic balance by leaving the center open for additional elements. The sofa's dimensions are 3.211 meters in length, 1.018 meters in width, and 0.784 meters in height, ensuring it fits comfortably along the wall without spatial conflicts.

The round coffee table, measuring 1.05 meters in diameter and 0.35 meters in height, is placed directly in front of the sofa, centered to allow symmetrical access from the seating area. This placement enhances the room's aesthetic balance and ensures functionality by providing a convenient surface for drinks and items.

The woven rug, with dimensions of 1.996 meters by 1.996 meters, is placed under the coffee table, centralizing the seating arrangement and providing comfort underfoot. This placement maintains balance and proportion, enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal by defining the seating area.

The side table, measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.6 meters, is positioned on the right side of the sofa, adjacent to it. This placement ensures balance and symmetry in the room, providing additional surface space for items like remote controls and books.

Cushion_1 and Cushion_2, both measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters, are placed on the sofa to enhance comfort and align with the user's vision of a plush seating area. Cushion_1 is blue, adding a pop of color, while Cushion_2 is green, providing additional comfort and aesthetic appeal.

The wall art, measuring 1.2 meters in length, 0.05 meters in width, and 0.8 meters in height, is placed on the north wall, centered to maintain balance and symmetry. This placement ensures the art is visible from the seating area, enhancing the room's overall aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited length of the south wall, which could not accommodate all intended objects, including the floor lamp, coffee table, sofa, and side table. To resolve this, the floor lamp was removed, as it was deemed less critical to the user's preference for a comfortable living space centered around the sofa, coffee table, and rug. This adjustment ensures the room remains functional and aesthetically pleasing, adhering to the user's vision.
