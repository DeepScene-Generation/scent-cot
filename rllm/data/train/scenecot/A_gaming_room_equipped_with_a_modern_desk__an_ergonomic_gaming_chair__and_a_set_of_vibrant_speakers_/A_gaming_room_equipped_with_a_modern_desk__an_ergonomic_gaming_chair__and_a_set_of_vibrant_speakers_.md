## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern gaming room that emphasizes both aesthetics and functionality. Key elements include a modern desk, an ergonomic gaming chair, and a vibrant speaker system. The room should also feature ambient lighting and personalized decor to enhance the gaming atmosphere. The user prioritizes a setup that supports comfort and productivity, with an immersive audio experience being a significant focus. Additional considerations include a gaming monitor, keyboard, mouse, and console to complete the gaming setup, with a preference for maintaining a modern aesthetic throughout.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Gaming Station is central, featuring the desk and chair for ergonomic and efficient gaming. The Audio Zone is designed to optimize sound distribution with strategically placed speakers. The Decor Area includes personalized elements like posters to reflect the user's interests. Finally, the Lighting Zone ensures ambient illumination to enhance the room's atmosphere.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Gaming Station, a modern desk (2.146m x 0.9m x 0.731m) and an ergonomic gaming chair (0.627m x 0.603m x 0.778m) are recommended. The Audio Zone features two sets of modern speakers (each 0.6m x 0.275m x 0.246m) to provide vibrant sound. The Decor Area includes a modern poster (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.5m) to add a personal touch. The Lighting Zone is equipped with a modern ambient light (0.453m x 0.367m x 0.122m) to ensure even illumination.

## 4. Scene Graph
The desk is the central piece of the gaming setup, placed against the north wall to maximize space efficiency and provide a stable, ergonomic setup. Its dimensions (2.146m x 0.9m x 0.731m) allow it to fit comfortably, facing the south wall, ensuring balance and symmetry in the room. This placement aligns with user preferences for a modern gaming setup and allows for optimal placement of other objects like the chair and speakers.

The gaming chair is positioned directly in front of the desk, facing the south wall, to facilitate comfortable gaming. Its dimensions (0.627m x 0.603m x 0.778m) ensure it fits without occupying excessive space, maintaining ergonomic seating and aligning with the room's modern aesthetic.

The speakers are placed on the desk to save floor space and ensure sound is directed towards the user. Each speaker (0.6m x 0.275m x 0.246m) is positioned symmetrically on either side of the desk, facing the south wall, to enhance the gaming experience with balanced audio distribution.

The poster is placed on the west wall to add visual interest without cluttering the space. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.5m) allow it to enhance the room's aesthetic appeal while maintaining the modern theme.

The ambient light is centrally placed on the ceiling to provide even illumination throughout the room. Its dimensions (0.453m x 0.367m x 0.122m) ensure it does not obstruct any existing objects, enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the placement of the console on the desk, as it could not be positioned left of the monitor due to the presence of speakers. To resolve this, the console was repositioned in front of the monitor, ensuring it remains accessible and functional without obstructing other objects. Additionally, the desk was too small to accommodate all intended objects, leading to the removal of the console to prioritize the user's preference for a vibrant speaker setup and maintain the room's functionality.
