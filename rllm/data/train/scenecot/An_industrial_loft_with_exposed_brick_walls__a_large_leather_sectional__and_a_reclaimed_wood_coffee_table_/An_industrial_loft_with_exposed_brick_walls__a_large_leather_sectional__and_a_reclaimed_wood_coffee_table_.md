## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires an industrial loft-style room characterized by exposed brick walls, a large leather sectional, and a reclaimed wood coffee table. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes maintaining an industrial theme with functional and aesthetic appeal, highlighting the importance of an open layout for free movement. Additional seating, accent pieces, and industrial-style lighting are suggested to enhance the ambiance, while a rug and wall art are recommended to define the seating area and emphasize the industrial theme.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to align with the user's industrial loft theme. The Central Seating Area is the focal point, featuring the leather sectional and coffee table. The Lighting Area is designed to provide ambient lighting with industrial-style floor lamps. The Decorative Area includes wall art to enhance the aesthetic appeal, while the Storage Area features a bookshelf for storage and display. The Rug Area defines the seating space, adding warmth and texture to the room.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Central Seating Area, a large leather sectional (3.0m x 1.5m x 0.8m) and a reclaimed wood coffee table (1.2m x 0.7m x 0.4m) are recommended. The Lighting Area includes a metal floor lamp (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.8m) to provide ambient lighting. The Decorative Area features multicolor canvas wall art (1.5m x 0.1m x 1.0m) to enhance the industrial theme. The Storage Area includes a metal bookshelf (1.0m x 0.3m x 2.0m) for storage and display. A grey wool rug (2.0m x 2.0m) is recommended to define the seating area and add warmth.

## 4. Scene Graph
The sectional is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, as it is a substantial piece of furniture that aligns with the user's preference for an industrial loft style. This placement maximizes open space in the middle of the room, ideal for a loft setting, and ensures the sectional becomes a focal point while maintaining an open, airy feel. The coffee table is placed directly in front of the sectional, ensuring easy access to drinks and decor. Its central placement aligns with the industrial style and adheres to design principles of balance and proportion.

The floor lamp is positioned on the south wall, right of the sectional, to provide optimal lighting for the seating area. This placement avoids blocking pathways and maintains the industrial style with its metal finish. The rug is placed under the coffee table, in the middle of the room, to visually anchor the seating arrangement and define the central area without obstructing movement. The wall art is centered on the north wall, facing the south wall, to serve as a focal point when viewed from the seating area, enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal. The bookshelf is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall, to provide storage/display space without impeding movement, complementing the industrial theme with its metal material.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the length of the south wall being too small to accommodate all intended objects, including the sectional, armchair, floor lamp, and stool. To resolve this, the stool and armchair were removed, as they were deemed less critical to the user's preference for an industrial loft with a large leather sectional and reclaimed wood coffee table. This resolution maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal while adhering to the user's primary requirements.
