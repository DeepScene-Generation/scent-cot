## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a sunroom characterized by natural light and warmth, serving as a space for relaxation and plant display. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for additional furniture and decor. The user emphasizes a preference for a bohemian style, incorporating a rattan armchair, a small plant stand, and a patterned throw pillow. The primary functional needs include creating a cozy reading area, a plant display, and a comfortable seating zone, all while maintaining a serene and natural atmosphere.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main substructures: the Sunlight Reading Area, the Plant Stand Area, and the Comfort Seating Zone. The Sunlight Reading Area is designed to accommodate the rattan armchair and a side table, providing a space for reading and relaxation. The Plant Stand Area focuses on displaying plants to enhance the natural vibe of the room. Lastly, the Comfort Seating Zone includes the throw pillow and a small rug to create a cozy and inviting atmosphere.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sunlight Reading Area, a bohemian-style rattan armchair with dimensions of 0.8 meters by 0.7 meters by 1.0 meter is recommended. The Plant Stand Area features a modern metal plant stand measuring 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.8 meters, along with a potted plant to add greenery. In the Comfort Seating Zone, a patterned throw pillow (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters) is suggested to enhance the seating comfort and aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The rattan armchair is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement takes advantage of natural light, aligning with the user's preference for a bright sunroom. The armchair's dimensions (0.8m x 0.7m x 1.0m) fit comfortably in this location, ensuring it does not block light from other directions. The armchair's bohemian style complements the room's casual and relaxed layout, creating a cozy seating area.

The plant stand is positioned on the south wall, to the right of the rattan armchair, facing the north wall. This placement maintains balance and allows for easy access to the plants for care. The plant stand's dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.8m) ensure it fits well beside the armchair, creating a harmonious and functional corner that aligns with the user's vision of a bright sunroom.

The throw pillow is placed on the rattan armchair, leaning against the backrest. This placement enhances the seating comfort and aligns with the user's input for a cozy seating area. The pillow's bohemian style and patterned color add vibrancy to the neutral tone of the rattan, contributing to the room's aesthetic without cluttering the space.

The potted plant is placed on the plant stand, right of the rattan armchair, against the south wall. This placement ensures the plant is elevated and visible, enhancing the room's aesthetics without occupying additional floor space. The plant's dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) fit comfortably on the stand, contributing to the sunroom's decor and aligning with the user's preference for a plant-filled space.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the plant stand's limited space, which could not accommodate both potted plants. To resolve this, the second potted plant (potted_plant_2) was removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a bright sunroom with a rattan armchair, a small plant stand, and a patterned throw pillow. Additionally, the south wall's length was insufficient to accommodate all intended objects, leading to the removal of the side table and rug. This decision was made to maintain the room's functionality and aesthetic, focusing on essential items that align with the user's vision.
