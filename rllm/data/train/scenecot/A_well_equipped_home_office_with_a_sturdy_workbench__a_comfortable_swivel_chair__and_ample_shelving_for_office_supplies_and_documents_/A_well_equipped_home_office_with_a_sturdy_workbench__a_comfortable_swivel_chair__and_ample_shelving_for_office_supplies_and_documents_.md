## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a home office that is both well-equipped and organized, with essential items including a sturdy workbench, a comfortable swivel chair, and ample shelving for storage. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes the need for a productive workspace with adequate lighting and a clean design. Additional objects such as a computer, filing cabinet, desk organizer, and corkboard are also considered necessary to fulfill both functional and aesthetic roles in the home office.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional areas based on the user's requirements. The Work Area is centered around the workbench, serving as the primary workspace. The Seating Area is designated for the swivel chair, providing comfort and flexibility. The Storage Area includes shelving and a filing cabinet for organizing office supplies and documents. The Lighting Area focuses on enhancing visibility with a desk lamp, while the Digital Task Area accommodates the computer. Lastly, the Note-taking Area is defined by the corkboard for pinning notes and reminders.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Work Area, a modern-style wooden workbench measuring 1.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended. The Seating Area features a modern leather swivel chair with dimensions of 0.627 meters by 0.603 meters by 0.778 meters. In the Storage Area, a modern metal shelving unit (1.5 meters by 0.3 meters by 2.0 meters) is proposed, along with a filing cabinet (0.6 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.75 meters) for additional storage. The Lighting Area includes a modern metal desk lamp (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.5 meters) to enhance visibility. The Digital Task Area is equipped with a modern plastic computer (0.4 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.5 meters). Finally, the Note-taking Area features a modern corkboard (0.892 meters by 0.02 meters by 0.604 meters) for organizing notes.

## 4. Scene Graph
The workbench is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, as it serves as the central work area. This placement ensures optimal accessibility and functionality, aligning with typical office setups where the main work surface faces an open area. The workbench's dimensions (1.8m x 0.8m x 0.75m) fit well against the wall, providing a stable position for work and storage.

The swivel chair is positioned in front of the workbench, facing the north wall. This placement ensures the chair is adjacent to the workbench, allowing the user to sit comfortably while working. The chair's dimensions (0.627m x 0.603m x 0.778m) allow it to fit comfortably in the designated seating area, maintaining balance and proportion within the room.

The shelving unit is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement provides ample storage space without obstructing movement or workspace. The shelving unit's dimensions (1.5m x 0.3m x 2.0m) ensure it fits comfortably against the wall, complementing the workbench and chair without overwhelming the space.

The desk lamp is placed on the workbench, providing optimal lighting for tasks performed at the workbench. The lamp's dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.5m) allow it to fit comfortably on the workbench without obstructing the workspace or interfering with the swivel chair's position.

The computer is placed on the workbench, facing the south wall. This placement ensures easy access and interaction with the computer while seated on the swivel chair. The computer's dimensions (0.4m x 0.3m x 0.5m) fit comfortably on the workbench alongside the desk lamp, maintaining a functional and aesthetic setup.

The desk organizer is placed on the workbench, to the left of the computer. This placement ensures easy access to frequently used items without obstructing the workspace. The desk organizer's dimensions (0.3m x 0.2m) allow it to fit comfortably on the workbench, maintaining balance and accessibility.

The corkboard is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures easy access and visibility for pinning notes and reminders. The corkboard's dimensions (0.892m x 0.02m x 0.604m) allow it to fit comfortably on the wall without obstructing movement or other functionalities.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the shelving unit and filing cabinet placement. The width of the shelving unit was too small to accommodate the filing cabinet to its left, leading to a spatial conflict. To resolve this, the filing cabinet was removed based on its lower functional priority compared to the shelving unit, which aligns with the user's preference for ample shelving for office supplies and documents. This resolution maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal as a well-equipped home office.
