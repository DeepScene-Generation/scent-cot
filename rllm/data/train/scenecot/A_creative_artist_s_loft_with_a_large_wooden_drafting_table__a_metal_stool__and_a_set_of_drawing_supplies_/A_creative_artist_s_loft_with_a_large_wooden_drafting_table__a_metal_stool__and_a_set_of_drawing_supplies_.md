## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a creative artist's loft characterized by a large wooden drafting table, a metal stool, and a set of drawing supplies. The room is designed to emphasize functionality and open space, fostering creativity with natural light and structural support. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user prefers a minimalist aesthetic with an industrial touch, focusing on ergonomic seating and accessible storage for drawing supplies. Additional elements such as an adjustable lamp, a cushioned seat pad, and an art easel are recommended to enhance both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures. The Central Drafting Area is the focal point, featuring the large wooden drafting table and metal stool for artistic work. The Drawing Supplies Storage Area is designated for organizing art materials, ensuring accessibility and maintaining a minimalist look. The Creative Movement Space surrounds the drafting table, providing unobstructed space for artistic expression. The Natural Light Zone is optimized near windows to enhance lighting, with a mirror suggested to distribute light effectively. Lastly, the Structural Support Area ensures the stability of the heavy drafting table.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Central Drafting Area, a large wooden drafting table and a metal stool are recommended, both reflecting an industrial style. The Drawing Supplies Storage Area benefits from a wooden storage cabinet or shelf to organize materials. To enhance lighting, a modern metal lamp is suggested, while a cushioned seat pad adds comfort to the stool. An art easel is proposed for versatile artistic activities, and a mirror is recommended to enhance natural light distribution. Drawing supplies, including charcoal sticks, pastel sets, and sketch paper, are essential for the room's artistic functionality.

## 4. Scene Graph
The drafting table, a central element of the artist's loft, is placed against the north wall, facing the same direction. This placement maximizes natural light and accessibility, aligning with the user's vision of a clutter-free creative space. The table's dimensions (1.8m x 1.2m x 0.9m) fit comfortably within the room, providing ample space for artistic work. The metal stool is positioned left of the drafting table, facing it, ensuring ergonomic seating and easy access. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.6m) allow for sufficient legroom and movement space. The storage cabinet is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, ensuring easy access to drawing supplies without obstructing the workflow. Its dimensions (1.08m x 0.395m x 1.065m) complement the room's minimalist aesthetic. The lamp is placed on the drafting table, facing the south wall, providing direct lighting for artistic work. Its compact size (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) ensures it does not interfere with other objects. The seat pad is placed on the metal stool, enhancing comfort without altering its placement. The mirror is positioned on the south wall beside the storage cabinet, facing the north wall, to reflect light towards the drafting table. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.05m x 1.5m) fit well beside the cabinet. The art easel is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall, providing ample space for creative movement. Its dimensions (0.7m x 0.7m x 1.8m) ensure it does not obstruct access to other objects. Finally, the drawing supplies are placed on the drafting table, adjacent to the metal stool, ensuring easy accessibility during artistic activities. Their small size (0.5m x 0.3m x 0.2m) allows them to fit comfortably without obstructing the workspace.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the initial placement of the metal stool in front of the drafting table, as it would have been out of bounds. To resolve this, the stool was repositioned to the left of the drafting table, maintaining its adjacency and functionality without spatial conflicts. This adjustment ensures the stool remains accessible and complements the drafting table, adhering to the room's design principles and user preferences.
