## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a cozy café corner within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The desired ambiance is warm and inviting, suitable for intimate conversations. Essential elements include a small round table, a pair of wicker chairs, and a chalkboard menu. The user emphasizes the need for comfortable seating and a table that allows easy access and movement. Additional elements such as a ceiling light fixture, a small rug, a potted plant, and a decorative piece are suggested to enhance the cozy atmosphere and add natural textures and charm.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The Central Seating Area is designated for the small round table and wicker chairs, serving as the primary gathering spot. The Display Area on the south wall is intended for the chalkboard menu, providing a focal point for the café's specials. The Lighting Area is centered above the table to ensure adequate illumination. The Floor Area beneath the table and chairs is defined by a small rug, enhancing the cozy feel. Lastly, the Decorative Area includes a potted plant and a decorative piece to add natural and aesthetic elements to the space.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Central Seating Area, a rustic wooden table (0.8m x 0.8m x 0.75m) and two wicker chairs (each 0.5m x 0.5m x 0.9m) are recommended to foster interaction and comfort. The Display Area features a vintage-style chalkboard (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.2m) for showcasing the café menu. The Lighting Area includes a modern metal light fixture (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m) to provide ambient lighting. A bohemian-style rug (1.2m x 1.2m) is suggested for the Floor Area to define the café corner. The Decorative Area is enhanced with a modern ceramic plant (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) and a minimalist glass decorative piece (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.3m) to add charm and sophistication.

## 4. Scene Graph
The rustic wooden table is placed centrally in the room to serve as the focal point of the café corner. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.8m x 0.75m) allow for easy access from all sides, and it faces the north wall, aligning with the user's preference for a cozy setup. This central placement ensures balance and proportion, enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal.

Chair_1 is positioned to the right of the table, facing the west wall. Its placement adjacent to the table (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.9m) encourages interaction and comfort, aligning with the user's desire for a cozy café corner. Chair_2 is placed to the left of the table, facing the east wall, directly opposite chair_1. This symmetrical arrangement promotes communication and maintains balance around the table.

The chalkboard menu is mounted on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.2m) fit comfortably on the wall, providing a backdrop for the café setup without interfering with the central seating arrangement. The light fixture is installed on the ceiling directly above the table, facing downwards. This placement ensures even illumination of the café corner, enhancing both functionality and aesthetics.

The bohemian-style rug is placed under the table and chairs, covering the immediate area of the café corner setup. Its dimensions (1.2m x 1.2m) define the space effectively, providing a unified look without overwhelming the room. The plant is positioned against the east wall, slightly towards the south-east corner, facing the west wall. This placement adds visual interest without obstructing movement or views.

Finally, the decorative piece is placed on the table, serving as a centerpiece. Its minimalist design and small size (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.3m) add elegance and sophistication to the setup without occupying too much space or interfering with functionality.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The arrangement of objects in the room adheres to the user's preferences and design principles, ensuring a harmonious and inviting café corner. Each object contributes both functionally and aesthetically to the overall ambiance, with no need for repositioning or deletion.

For plant_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No rotation difference calculation needed
        - conclusion: No directional constraint applied
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'east_wall' relation
        - calculation:
            - plant_1 size: 0.3 (length)
            - Cluster size (east_wall): max(0.0, 0.3) = 0.3
        - conclusion: plant_1 cluster size (east_wall): 0.3
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'east_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - plant_1 size: length=0.3, width=0.3, height=0.6
            - Room size: 5.0x5.0x3.0
            - x_min = x_max = 4.85
            - y_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 0.3/2 = 0.15
            - y_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 0.3/2 = 4.85
            - z_min = z_max = 0.6/2 = 0.3
        - conclusion: Possible position: (4.85, 4.85, 0.15, 4.85, 0.3, 0.3)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(4.85-4.85), y(0.15-4.85)

        - conclusion: Final position: x: 4.85, y: 4.500018299862325, z: 0.3
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
