## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a home cinema room featuring a wide-screen television, surround sound speakers, and a collection of classic films. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The layout specifies the south wall for the television, the west wall for film storage, the middle of the room for seating, and the ceiling for lighting. The user prioritizes a modern aesthetic with functional elements that enhance the cinematic experience, such as plush seating and dimmable lighting.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Viewing Area is located on the south wall, designated for the television and speakers to create an immersive cinematic experience. The Film Storage Area is on the west wall, intended for organizing and displaying the user's collection of classic films. The Seating Area occupies the middle of the room, providing comfortable seating options like a sofa and recliners. The Lighting Area is on the ceiling, designed to offer adjustable lighting to suit different viewing conditions.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Viewing Area, a modern-style television with dimensions of 1.8 meters by 0.1 meters by 1.0 meters is recommended, along with surround sound speakers to enhance the audio experience. The Film Storage Area features a modern wooden storage unit (1.0 meters by 0.4 meters by 2.0 meters) to house the film collection. In the Seating Area, a modern gray fabric sofa (2.0 meters by 1.0 meters by 1.0 meters) and two black leather recliners (each 0.9 meters by 0.9 meters by 1.0 meters) are suggested for comfort. The Lighting Area includes a modern metal ceiling light (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.3 meters) to provide ambient illumination. A plush beige carpet (4.0 meters by 3.0 meters by 0.02 meters) is recommended to enhance comfort and aesthetics in the seating area.

## 4. Scene Graph
The television is the focal point of the home cinema room, mounted on the south wall to ensure optimal viewing from the seating area. Its dimensions (1.8m x 0.1m x 1.0m) fit well on the wall, and it is positioned centrally to provide a balanced layout. This placement aligns with the user's preference for a cinematic experience and adheres to design principles by allowing seating to face the screen.

Speaker_3 is placed in the middle of the room, facing the north wall, to complement the surround sound setup. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.5m) allow it to fit without spatial conflicts, enhancing the audio experience by providing balanced sound distribution.

The film storage unit is positioned against the west wall, facing east, to provide easy access to the film collection. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.4m x 2.0m) ensure it fits comfortably without obstructing other elements. The film collection is placed on top of the storage unit, maintaining visual coherence and easy access.

The sofa is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, to provide a comfortable viewing position. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 1.0m) fit well against the wall, ensuring it does not interfere with the speakers or television. Recliner_1 is positioned in the middle of the room, slightly left of the center, facing the south wall, while Recliner_2 is placed on the north wall, right of the sofa, also facing the south wall. Both recliners enhance the seating arrangement without obstructing the view or movement.

The ceiling light is centrally located on the ceiling to provide even illumination across the room. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.3m) ensure it does not interfere with other objects, maintaining aesthetic balance and fulfilling the functional need for lighting.

The carpet is placed in the middle of the room, under the sofa and recliners, to enhance comfort and aesthetics. Its dimensions (4.0m x 3.0m x 0.02m) allow it to cover the seating area without overlapping other objects, aligning with the user's preference for a cohesive home cinema environment.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited space on the south wall, which could not accommodate both speaker_1 and speaker_2 alongside the television. To resolve this, both speaker_1 and speaker_2 were removed, as speaker_3 in the middle of the room suffices to maintain the surround sound experience. This adjustment ensures the room remains functional and aesthetically pleasing, adhering to the user's vision for a home cinema room.
