## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern kitchen space characterized by a sleek metallic kitchen worktop, wooden kitchen utensils, and a white marble kitchen cabinet. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for a functional and aesthetically pleasing layout. The user desires a minimalist and modern style, emphasizing the need for a central placement of key kitchen elements to maintain an open and uncluttered environment. Additional elements such as a modern dining table, chairs, a small potted plant, and pendant lights are suggested to enhance both functionality and aesthetics, with a total item count not exceeding 14.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Kitchen Preparation Area is designated along the north wall, featuring the metallic kitchen worktop and utensils for meal preparation. The Storage Area is located along the west wall, housing the white marble kitchen cabinet for efficient storage. The Dining Area occupies the middle of the room, centered around a modern dining table and chairs for dining purposes. The Decorative Area is in the corner where the west and south walls meet, featuring a potted plant to add a touch of nature. Finally, the Lighting Area is above the dining table, where a pendant light enhances the ambiance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Kitchen Preparation Area, a sleek metallic kitchen worktop measuring 2.0 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.9 meters is recommended, complemented by a set of rustic wooden kitchen utensils. The Storage Area features a modern white marble kitchen cabinet with dimensions of 1.08 meters by 0.395 meters by 1.065 meters. In the Dining Area, a modern black dining table (2.146 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.731 meters) is accompanied by four matching dining chairs, each measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.9 meters. The Decorative Area includes a minimalist ceramic potted plant (0.229 meters by 0.177 meters by 0.224 meters), while the Lighting Area features a modern gold pendant light (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 1.0 meters).

## 4. Scene Graph
The kitchen worktop, a central element for meal preparation, is placed against the north wall to maximize space efficiency and provide a stable work area. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.6m x 0.9m) allow it to fit comfortably without occupying excessive floor space, leaving the rest of the room open for other components. The wooden kitchen utensils are placed on the worktop, ensuring easy access during cooking tasks. Their small size (0.131m x 0.127m x 0.317m) ensures they do not clutter the worktop, maintaining a functional and sleek kitchen space.

The white marble kitchen cabinet is positioned against the west wall, providing storage without disrupting the meal preparation area. Its placement complements the kitchen worktop, forming an L-shape that enhances functionality and aesthetics. The cabinet's dimensions (1.08m x 0.395m x 1.065m) ensure it fits well against the wall, maintaining a balanced layout.

The dining table is centrally placed in the room, facing the north wall, to provide a focal point for dining activities. Its modern style and dimensions (2.146m x 0.9m x 0.731m) align with the room's sleek aesthetic, allowing movement around it. Four dining chairs are arranged symmetrically around the table: one to the right, one to the left, one behind, and one in front, ensuring functional seating and maintaining balance. Each chair measures 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.9 meters.

The potted plant is placed in the corner where the west and south walls meet, adding a decorative element without interfering with the kitchen or dining areas. Its minimalist style and small size (0.229m x 0.177m x 0.224m) enhance the room's aesthetic without cluttering the space.

The pendant light is suspended from the ceiling above the dining table, providing central lighting that highlights the dining area. Its placement ensures even illumination and complements the room's modern style, enhancing both functionality and visual appeal.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The layout effectively accommodates all objects, ensuring a functional and aesthetically pleasing kitchen space. The arrangement maintains balance and proportion, adhering to the user's modern and minimalist preferences.
