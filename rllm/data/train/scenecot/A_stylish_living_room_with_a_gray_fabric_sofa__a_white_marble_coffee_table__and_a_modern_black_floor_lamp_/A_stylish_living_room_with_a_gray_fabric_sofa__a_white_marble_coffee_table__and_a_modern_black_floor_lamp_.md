## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a stylish living room that serves as a sophisticated sanctuary, emphasizing a harmonious blend of comfort and elegance. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for both essential and additional items. Key elements include a gray fabric sofa, a white marble coffee table, and a modern black floor lamp, which are central to the room's primary purpose of relaxation and casual socialization. The user desires a modern and elegant theme, with additional objects considered to enhance functionality and aesthetics.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to align with the user's requirements. The Seating Area is centered around the gray fabric sofa, serving as the primary relaxation zone. The Coffee Table Area is positioned in front of the sofa, providing a functional space for placing items. The Lighting Area includes the modern black floor lamp, enhancing the room's ambiance. The Decorative Area features wall art on the north wall, adding visual interest and personalization. Additional substructures, such as potential spaces for accent chairs and side tables, are considered to maintain balance and functionality.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a modern gray fabric sofa with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.8 meters is recommended. The Coffee Table Area features a white marble coffee table measuring 1.2 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters, complementing the sofa. The Lighting Area includes a modern black floor lamp with dimensions of 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.8 meters, providing ambient lighting. The Decorative Area is enhanced with multicolor wall art on canvas, measuring 1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 0.8 meters. Additional recommendations include accent chairs, a rug, and a side table to further define the seating area and add texture and warmth.

## 4. Scene Graph
The gray fabric sofa is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, serving as the focal point of the living room. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.9m x 0.8m) fit comfortably within the room, providing balance and symmetry. This placement aligns with the user's preference for a stylish living room and enhances functionality by maintaining open space for other objects.

The white marble coffee table is positioned in front of the sofa, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.4m) ensure it fits comfortably without spatial conflicts, maintaining balance and proportion. This placement adheres to user preferences and design principles, enhancing the room's style and functionality.

The modern black floor lamp is placed to the left of the sofa, facing the east wall. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.8m) allow it to fit comfortably, providing lighting for the seating area. This placement adds verticality and balance, enhancing the room's modern aesthetic.

The multicolor wall art is hung on the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.8m) ensure it serves as a decorative focal point without spatial conflicts. This placement enhances the room's aesthetic appeal, aligning with the user's vision for a stylish living room.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to the limited space on the south wall and the small width of the accent chair, which could not accommodate additional objects like the side table and plant. To resolve these conflicts, the plant was removed, as it was deemed less critical to the user's preference for a stylish living room centered around the sofa, coffee table, and floor lamp. Additionally, the side table, table lamp, accent chair, and rug were also removed to maintain the room's functionality and aesthetic balance, ensuring the primary elements remain the focus.
