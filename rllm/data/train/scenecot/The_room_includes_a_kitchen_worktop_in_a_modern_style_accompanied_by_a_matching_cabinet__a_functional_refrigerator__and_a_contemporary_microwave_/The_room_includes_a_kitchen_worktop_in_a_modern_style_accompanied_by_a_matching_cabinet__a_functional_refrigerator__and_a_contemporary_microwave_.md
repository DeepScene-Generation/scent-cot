## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern kitchen that includes essential elements such as a worktop, cabinet, refrigerator, and microwave, all within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary focus is on functionality and aesthetics, with a preference for a modern style that incorporates materials like stainless steel and glass. The kitchen should facilitate meal preparation and storage while maintaining ergonomic pathways for safe and efficient movement. Additionally, the user desires a dining area within the kitchen, complemented by proper lighting and ventilation to ensure a comfortable cooking environment.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The kitchen is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Cooking Area includes the kitchen worktop and cabinet, providing space for meal preparation and storage. The Storage Area is designated for the refrigerator and microwave, ensuring easy access to food and quick heating options. The Dining Area is centrally located, featuring a dining table and chairs for eating. The Lighting and Ventilation Area focuses on ceiling-mounted elements to enhance visibility and air circulation, contributing to a comfortable and modern kitchen environment.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Cooking Area, a modern kitchen worktop measuring 4.0 meters in length is recommended, complemented by a matching cabinet of 2.0 meters in length for additional storage. The Storage Area includes a stainless steel refrigerator with a width of 0.7 meters and a contemporary microwave. In the Dining Area, a transparent glass dining table (1.5 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.75 meters) is suggested, accompanied by modern metal chairs for seating. The Lighting and Ventilation Area features a modern metal ceiling light and a ventilation system, both designed to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dining table, a central element of the Dining Area, is placed in the middle of the room, facing the north wall. Its transparent glass material and modern style complement the kitchen's aesthetic, while its central placement allows for easy access from all sides, ensuring functionality as a dining space. The table's dimensions (1.5m x 0.9m x 0.75m) provide ample space for dining chairs without obstructing movement.

Dining chair 1 is positioned behind the dining table, facing the north wall. This placement ensures no conflict with other objects and respects the table's central position, allowing balanced access to the table from other sides. The chair's modern metal design and dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) align with the room's aesthetic and functional requirements.

Dining chair 2 is placed in front of the dining table, facing the south wall. This arrangement provides symmetry and additional seating, allowing diners to sit comfortably facing the table. The chair's modern style and dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) ensure it complements the existing decor and maintains the room's modern aesthetic.

The ceiling light is installed centrally on the ceiling, ensuring even distribution of light throughout the room. Its modern metal design and small size (0.161m x 0.161m x 0.776m) prevent it from overwhelming the space, while its placement above the dining table aligns with the symmetrical arrangement of the dining area, enhancing the room's aesthetic and functionality.

The ventilation system is also ceiling-mounted, positioned to avoid overlap with the ceiling light. Its dimensions (1.0m x 1.0m x 0.3m) allow it to fit comfortably on the ceiling, providing optimal air circulation throughout the room. This placement aligns with typical design practices for ventilation systems and complements the room's modern style.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to the limited space on the south wall, which could not accommodate all desired kitchen elements, including the kitchen worktop, cabinet, refrigerator, and microwave. To resolve this, the microwave was repositioned to the left of the refrigerator on the kitchen worktop, ensuring no spatial conflicts and maintaining the modern kitchen layout. Ultimately, due to space constraints and prioritizing functionality, the microwave, cabinet, and refrigerator were removed, focusing on the dining area and ceiling elements to maintain the room's modern aesthetic and functionality.
