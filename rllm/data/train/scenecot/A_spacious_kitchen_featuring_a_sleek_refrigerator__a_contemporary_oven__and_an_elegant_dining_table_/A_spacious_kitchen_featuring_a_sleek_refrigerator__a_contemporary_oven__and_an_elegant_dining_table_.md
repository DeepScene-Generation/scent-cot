## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a spacious kitchen that embodies modern and elegant aesthetics. Key elements include a sleek refrigerator, a contemporary oven, and an elegant dining table. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for these essential kitchen components. The user desires a layout that ensures efficient use of space and functionality, with specific placements for the refrigerator, oven, and dining table to create a welcoming and practical kitchen environment.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The kitchen is divided into three main areas based on functionality and aesthetics: the Refrigerator Area, the Oven Area, and the Dining Area. The Refrigerator Area is designed for ingredient storage and may include additional storage solutions. The Oven Area focuses on cooking efficiency, potentially incorporating a range hood and countertop space. The Dining Area is intended to create a welcoming ambiance, featuring the dining table and seating that complements the table's style.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Refrigerator Area, a modern stainless steel refrigerator is recommended. The Oven Area includes a sleek black oven and a matching range hood for ventilation. The Dining Area features an elegant dark brown wooden dining table with four matching chairs, enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal. Additional elements such as a kitchen island, fruit bowl, spice rack, and a decorative centerpiece are suggested to complement the main objects while maintaining the kitchen's openness and functionality.

## 4. Scene Graph
The refrigerator, a large and tall object measuring 0.9 meters by 0.7 meters by 2.0 meters, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement maximizes floor space and provides a visual anchor from the entrance, aligning with the modern style and ensuring easy access and functionality. The oven, measuring 0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.9 meters, is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. This avoids spatial conflicts with the refrigerator and maintains an open and functional layout, complementing the modern kitchen design.

The dining table, with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.0 meters by 0.75 meters, is centrally placed in the room, allowing for ease of movement and maintaining a functional flow. This central placement ensures balance and accessibility from all sides, aligning with the user's preference for a spacious kitchen. Four elegant chairs, each measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meters, are arranged around the table. Chair_1 is in front of the table facing the south wall, Chair_2 is behind it facing the north wall, Chair_3 is to the left facing the east wall, and Chair_4 is to the right facing the west wall. This symmetrical arrangement enhances the dining area's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The range hood, measuring 0.9 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.4 meters, is placed directly above the oven on the east wall, ensuring optimal ventilation and maintaining a cohesive look with the oven. The kitchen island, measuring 1.5 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.9 meters, is placed behind the dining table, facing the north wall. This placement enhances functionality by situating the preparation area close to the dining area without obstructing pathways.

Finally, the fruit bowl, a minimalist ceramic piece measuring 0.231 meters by 0.231 meters by 0.082 meters, is placed on the dining table. This placement enhances the table's aesthetic appeal and serves as an elegant centerpiece, aligning with the room's decor.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The layout effectively utilizes the available space, ensuring that all objects are placed without spatial conflicts and align with the user's preferences for a modern and elegant kitchen. The arrangement maintains balance, functionality, and aesthetic appeal, adhering to design principles and user requirements.
