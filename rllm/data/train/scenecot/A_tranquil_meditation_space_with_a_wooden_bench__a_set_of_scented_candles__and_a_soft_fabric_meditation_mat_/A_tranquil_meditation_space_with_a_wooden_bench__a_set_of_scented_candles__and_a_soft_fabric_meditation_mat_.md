## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a tranquil meditation space designed to promote relaxation and mindfulness. Essential elements include a wooden bench, a set of scented candles, and a soft fabric meditation mat. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user desires a serene environment that supports mindfulness practice, with specific areas designated for meditation, reflection, and ambiance enhancement.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The meditation space is divided into three main areas: the Meditation Mat Area, the Wooden Bench Reflection Area, and the Candle Arrangement Area. The Meditation Mat Area is centrally located to provide an open space for mindfulness practice. The Wooden Bench Reflection Area is positioned against the south wall, offering a seating option that complements the meditation setup. The Candle Arrangement Area is designed to enhance tranquility with aromatic elements, strategically placed to permeate the room.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Meditation Mat Area, a minimalist fabric meditation mat measuring 1.8 meters by 0.6 meters is recommended. The Wooden Bench Reflection Area features a natural wood bench (1.2 meters by 0.4 meters) for seating. The Candle Arrangement Area includes three sets of contemporary scented candles, each compact in size, to enhance the room's aroma. Additional objects such as a small fountain and a storage basket are suggested to further enhance ambiance and functionality.

## 4. Scene Graph
The meditation mat is placed in the middle of the room, serving as the focal point for mindfulness practice. Its dimensions (1.8m x 0.6m x 0.02m) allow for ample space around it, promoting relaxation and focus. This central placement ensures balance and symmetry, aligning with the principles of tranquility and calmness desired in a meditation area.

The wooden bench is positioned against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement provides stability and keeps the center of the room open for the meditation mat. The bench's natural wood color harmonizes with the room's aesthetic, enhancing the meditation setup's functionality by offering a restful seating option.

The scented candles are placed on the wooden bench, facing the north wall. This arrangement allows their aroma to spread effectively throughout the room, enhancing the tranquil environment. The candles' compact size ensures they fit comfortably on the bench without intruding on the meditation mat's space.

The small fountain is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.5m) make it a suitable addition to the meditation space, enhancing ambiance with its calming water feature. This placement allows the fountain's sound to resonate throughout the room, creating a focal point visible from the bench.

The storage basket is placed on the floor next to the meditation mat, facing the north wall. Its natural material and color blend seamlessly with the room's theme, providing easy access to stored items such as meditation props or blankets. This placement maintains the room's open and tranquil atmosphere, complementing the mat without obstructing movement or view.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose with the floor lamp and small table. The floor lamp could not be placed to the left of the small table due to the wooden bench's position. Additionally, the wooden bench's width was insufficient to accommodate the small table, leading to its removal. To resolve these conflicts, both the small table and floor lamp were deleted, prioritizing the user's preference for a tranquil meditation space with essential elements like the wooden bench, scented candles, and meditation mat.
