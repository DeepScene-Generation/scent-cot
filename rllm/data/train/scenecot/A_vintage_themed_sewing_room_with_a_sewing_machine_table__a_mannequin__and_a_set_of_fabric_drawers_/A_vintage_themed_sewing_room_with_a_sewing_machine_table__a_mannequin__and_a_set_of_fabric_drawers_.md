## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a vintage-themed sewing room that emphasizes functionality and aesthetic appeal. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key requirements include a sewing station with a sewing machine table, ergonomic seating, and adequate lighting. The user also desires a mannequin for draping, fabric storage solutions, and an open workspace for cutting fabric. Additional elements such as a vintage clock, decorative rug, and wall-mounted shelf are suggested to enhance the room's vintage charm and functionality.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures. The Sewing Station is the primary area, featuring the sewing machine table and ergonomic chair. The Mannequin Area is designated for garment draping and adjustments. The Fabric Storage Area includes drawers for organizing materials. The Open Workspace is centrally located for cutting and layout tasks. Additional areas include a Lighting Zone for task illumination, a Time Management Zone with a vintage clock, and a Display and Storage Zone with a wall-mounted shelf.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sewing Station, a vintage-style sewing machine table (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.75m) and an ergonomic chair (0.41m x 0.388m x 0.612m) are recommended. A vintage lamp (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) provides task lighting. The Mannequin Area features a vintage mannequin (0.4m x 0.3m x 1.6m). Fabric storage is addressed with vintage-style drawers (1.0m x 0.5m x 0.8m). The Open Workspace includes a decorative rug (2.0m x 1.5m) for aesthetic warmth. A vintage clock (0.3m x 0.1m x 0.3m) aids time management, while a wall shelf (1.0m x 0.3m x 0.2m) offers additional storage and display options.

## 4. Scene Graph
The sewing machine table, a central element, is placed against the north wall to maximize space and functionality. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.75m) fit well, allowing the user to face the entrance, enhancing workspace efficiency. The ergonomic chair, initially intended to be in front of the table, is repositioned to be in front of the north wall due to spatial constraints, maintaining functionality and aesthetic coherence. The vintage lamp is placed on the sewing machine table, providing focused lighting without cluttering the floor space. The mannequin is positioned against the east wall, offering easy access and maintaining visual balance with its height (1.6m). Fabric drawers are placed on the west wall, ensuring easy access and symmetry with the sewing machine table. The vintage clock is placed on the fabric drawers, ensuring visibility and complementing the vintage theme. The decorative rug is centrally placed, slightly extending under the chair, defining the open workspace and adding warmth. The wall shelf is mounted on the east wall, providing accessible storage and display space, enhancing the room's functionality and vintage aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the initial placement of the ergonomic chair, which was out of bounds when placed in front of the sewing machine table. This was resolved by repositioning the chair to be in front of the north wall, ensuring it remains functional and aesthetically aligned with the room's layout. Another conflict involved the limited space on the sewing machine table, which could not accommodate both the vintage lamp and the cutting mat. The cutting mat was removed, prioritizing the lamp for its essential lighting function, aligning with the user's preference for a vintage-themed sewing room.

                - Rotation difference: |90.0 - 90.0| = 0.0°
            - conclusion: Using length dimension for directional constraint
        2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'on' relation
            - calculation:
                - fabric_drawers_1 size: 1.0 (length)
                - Cluster size (on): max(0.0, 1.0) = 1.0
            - conclusion: vintage_clock_1 cluster size (on): 1.0
        3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'west_wall' constraint
            - calculation:
                - vintage_clock_1 size: length=0.3, width=0.1, height=0.3
                - Room size: 5.0x5.0x3.0
                - x_min = 0 + 0.0/2 + 0.1/2 = 0.05
                - x_max = 0 + 0.0/2 + 0.1/2 = 0.05
                - y_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 0.3/2 = 0.15
                - y_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 0.3/2 = 4.85
                - z_min = 1.5 - 3.0/2 + 0.3/2 = 0.15
                - z_max = 1.5 + 3.0/2 - 0.3/2 = 2.85
            - conclusion: Possible position: (0.05, 0.05, 0.15, 4.85, 0.15, 2.85)
        4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
            - calculation:
                - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.05-0.05), y(0.15-4.85)
                - Final coordinates: x=0.05, y=4.2106, z=0.95
            - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.05, y: 4.2106, z: 0.95
        5. reason: Collision check with fabric_drawers_1
            - calculation:
                - Overlap detection: 0.05 ≤ 0.05 ≤ 0.05 → No collision
            - conclusion: No collision detected
        6. reason: Final position calculation
            - calculation:
                - Selected position within overlap: x=0.05, y=4.2106, z=0.95
            - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.05, y: 4.2106, z: 0.95
