## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a small business office designed for meetings and presentations, with a focus on functionality and a professional aesthetic. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a rectangular conference table, ergonomic rolling chairs, and a presentation display. The user also desires additional items such as a whiteboard, storage cabinets, and a decorative plant to enhance the office's welcoming atmosphere. The style preference leans towards modern and minimalist, with a neutral color palette to maintain a professional and uncluttered environment.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The office is divided into several functional substructures based on user requirements. The central area is designated for the Conference Table Area, which serves as the focal point for meetings. The Presentation Display Area is positioned to ensure visibility from all seating positions. The Whiteboard Area is intended for brainstorming and note-taking, complementing the presentation setup. The Storage Area is allocated for organizing office supplies, while the Decorative Area enhances the office's aesthetic appeal with a plant.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Conference Table Area, a modern-style rectangular conference table measuring 3.0 meters by 1.2 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended. Surrounding the table are four ergonomic rolling chairs, each with dimensions of 0.686 meters by 0.681 meters by 1.043 meters, ensuring comfort and functionality. The Presentation Display Area features a modern glass and metal display, 1.5 meters by 0.1 meters by 1.0 meters, mounted on the north wall. A minimalist whiteboard, 1.8 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.2 meters, is proposed for the Whiteboard Area on the south wall. The Storage Area includes a modern wood storage cabinet, 0.962 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.86 meters, placed against the west wall. Finally, a modern decorative plant, 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meters, is recommended for the Decorative Area to enhance the room's ambiance.

## 4. Scene Graph
The conference table is centrally placed in the room, facing the north wall, to maximize space and functionality. Its dimensions (3.0m x 1.2m x 0.75m) allow for easy movement around it, essential for meetings. This central placement ensures balance and symmetry, with chairs arranged around it, aligning with modern design principles and user preferences for a business office. Ergonomic Chair 1 is positioned in front of the conference table, facing the south wall, ensuring it is adjacent to the table for functional and aesthetic alignment. Ergonomic Chair 2 is placed behind the table, facing the north wall, creating balance and symmetry in the seating arrangement. Ergonomic Chair 3 is to the right of the table, facing the west wall, while Ergonomic Chair 4 is to the left, facing the east wall, completing the circular seating arrangement around the table.

The presentation display is mounted on the north wall, facing the south wall, ensuring all chairs have a direct line of sight. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.1m x 1.0m) fit comfortably on the wall, and it is positioned approximately 1.5 meters above the floor for optimal visibility. The whiteboard is mounted on the south wall, facing the north wall, balancing the presentation display and allowing easy visibility from all seating positions. The storage cabinet is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall, providing accessible storage without disrupting the room's flow. Finally, the decorative plant is placed in the corner formed by the south and west walls, facing the center of the room, adding a visual point of interest without interfering with functionality.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects fit within the room's dimensions without overlapping or obstructing each other, maintaining a professional and functional office environment. The placement of each object aligns with user preferences and design principles, ensuring a cohesive and efficient meeting space.
