## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a minimalist bedroom characterized by simplicity and elegance. The primary elements include a double bed with white upholstery, a wooden nightstand, and a soft beige rug. The room's dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes a serene and calming atmosphere, focusing on rest and sleep, personal storage, and a harmonious color scheme. Additional recommendations include a minimalist chair, a floor lamp for ambient lighting, and a small dresser, with a total object count not exceeding eleven to maintain the room's uncluttered look.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main substructures: the Bed Area, Nightstand Area, and Rug Area. The Bed Area is designated for rest and sleep, serving as the focal point of the room. The Nightstand Area provides personal storage and convenience, while the Rug Area enhances comfort and warmth. These substructures are designed to maintain a harmonious and minimalist aesthetic, with additional areas for a chair, floor lamp, and dresser to enhance functionality and style.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Bed Area, a minimalist double bed with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.8 meters by 0.5 meters is recommended. The Nightstand Area features a wooden nightstand measuring 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.6 meters, providing storage and convenience. The Rug Area includes a soft beige rug (2.5 meters by 1.5 meters) to add comfort and warmth. Additional recommendations include a minimalist chair (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters), a floor lamp (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.5 meters) for ambient lighting, a small dresser (1.0 meter by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter) for clothing storage, and a plant (0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.0 meter) for aesthetic appeal.

## 4. Scene Graph
The bed is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, as it is the central element of the minimalist bedroom. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.8m x 0.5m) fit well within the room's size, allowing ample space for other furniture. This placement ensures easy access to both sides of the bed, aligning with the user's preference for a minimalist style and maintaining an open and airy feel.

The nightstand is positioned to the right of the bed along the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.4m x 0.6m) ensure it is within reach from the bed without obstructing pathways. This placement provides storage and convenience, adhering to the minimalist design and user preferences.

The rug is placed under the bed, extending into the middle of the room. Its dimensions (2.5m x 1.5m) allow it to anchor the bed and nightstand visually, providing comfort and warmth underfoot. This placement maintains balance and proportion, enhancing the room's aesthetic.

The floor lamp is placed to the right of the nightstand on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.5m) ensure it provides ambient lighting without obstructing movement. This placement complements the minimalist style and enhances the room's functionality.

The dresser is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.5m x 1.0m) ensure it does not obstruct existing objects and adds functionality without compromising the minimalist aesthetic. This placement balances the room by distributing furniture evenly.

The plant is placed on the north wall, left of the dresser, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.0m) allow it to contribute to the room's aesthetic appeal without obstructing movement or access. This placement provides a visual interest point, maintaining consistency with the room's design principles.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the south wall being too small to accommodate all intended objects, including the bed, nightstand, chair, and floor lamp. To resolve this, the chair was removed, as it was deemed the least essential for the user's preference and the room's functionality. This adjustment ensures the room maintains its minimalist aesthetic and functional layout.
