## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a vibrant playroom that emphasizes play, storage, and crafting activities. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for various activities. The primary requirements include a safe play area with soft surfaces, easy access to toys, a dedicated crafting space, and sufficient storage. The aesthetic preference is for a vibrant and playful color scheme, avoiding clutter while ensuring child safety.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main areas based on the user's requirements: a central play area with colorful mats, a toy storage unit on the south wall, and a craft table on the east side. The central play area is designed to provide a safe and inviting space for children to play. The toy storage area ensures toys are organized and easily accessible, while the crafting area facilitates creative activities with a dedicated table and storage for art supplies.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central play area, colorful play mats are recommended to provide a safe and vibrant surface for children. The toy storage area features a modern, multi-compartment storage unit to organize toys and maintain a tidy environment. The crafting area includes a modern craft table with storage compartments for art supplies, complemented by chairs for seating. Additional items such as bean bags for comfortable seating and a small bookshelf for storing books or supplies enhance the room's functionality and comfort. All objects are selected to adhere to child-safe materials and vibrant colors, maintaining the room's playful atmosphere.

## 4. Scene Graph
The play mat (play_mat_1) is essential for providing a safe play surface and setting the room's tone. It is placed centrally in the room, measuring 2.0 meters by 2.0 meters by 0.02 meters, to allow children easy access from all sides and to define a clear play area. This central placement ensures no spatial conflicts with other objects and aligns with the user's preference for a vibrant play area. Play_mat_2, identical in dimensions, is placed adjacent to play_mat_1, extending the play area without obstruction and maintaining the room's vibrant theme.

The toy storage unit, measuring 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.2 meters, is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement ensures easy access to toys from the central play area and maintains balance by utilizing available wall space. The craft table, measuring 1.0 meter by 0.6 meters by 0.5 meters, is positioned against the south wall, facing the north wall. This location keeps the central area open for play and complements the room's layout and style.

Chair_1, measuring 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.8 meters, is placed in front of the craft table, facing the south wall, providing optimal functionality for crafting activities. Chair_2, identical in dimensions, is placed to the right of the craft table, facing the west wall, ensuring adjacency for functional use. The bean bag, measuring 0.9 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.7 meters, is placed adjacent to the play mats in the central area, facing the north wall, offering a relaxing seating option without interfering with other activities.

The bookshelf, measuring 0.8 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.2 meters, is placed on the south wall, left of the craft table, facing the north wall. This placement enhances the functionality of the craft area and contributes to the room's vibrant and organized feel. The art supply organizer, measuring 0.5 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters, is placed on the craft table, ensuring easy access to supplies during crafting activities and maintaining harmony with the room’s layout.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were positioned to ensure functionality and aesthetic appeal, adhering to the user's vision for a vibrant and interactive playroom. The arrangement maintains balance and proportion, with no spatial conflicts or obstructions, ensuring a safe and engaging environment for children.

For art_supply_organizer_1
- parent object: craft_table_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with craft_table_1
        - calculation:
            - Rotation of art_supply_organizer_1: 0.0°
