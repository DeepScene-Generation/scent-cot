## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a chic living room that combines elegance and comfort, featuring a fabric L-shaped sofa, a marble coffee table, and a sleek TV stand as central elements. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design emphasizes a stylish and modern aesthetic, with a preference for a layout that supports seating, central surface functionality, and entertainment access. The user desires a balance between functionality and decorative elements, ensuring the room remains uncluttered and maintains a chic appearance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main substructures: the L-shaped Sofa Area, the Marble Coffee Table Area, and the TV Stand Area. The L-shaped Sofa Area is designated for seating and comfort, potentially enhanced with decorative cushions and a throw. The Marble Coffee Table Area serves as a central surface for the room, possibly featuring a decorative centerpiece to add visual interest. The TV Stand Area is intended for entertainment access, with the potential addition of media accessories like a soundbar to improve the audio experience. Each substructure is designed to fulfill specific functional and aesthetic roles while maintaining a harmonious flow throughout the room.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the L-shaped Sofa Area, a chic fabric L-shaped sofa in light gray is recommended, complemented by decorative cushions in teal and beige for added comfort and style. The Marble Coffee Table Area features a chic white marble coffee table, with a modern ceramic vase as a decorative centerpiece. The TV Stand Area includes a sleek black wooden TV stand, accompanied by a modern black plastic soundbar to enhance audio quality. These objects are chosen to align with the user's chic aesthetic preference while ensuring functionality and visual appeal.

## 4. Scene Graph
The L-shaped sofa is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to maximize space and provide a clear view of the room, particularly the TV stand. Its dimensions are 3.211 meters in length, 1.018 meters in width, and 0.784 meters in height, fitting comfortably along the south wall. This placement leaves ample space for the coffee table in front and the TV stand against the north wall, ensuring the sofa remains a central element of the chic living room.

The marble coffee table is centrally placed in front of the sofa, facing the south wall. With dimensions of 1.2 meters in length, 0.7 meters in width, and 0.4 meters in height, it fits comfortably without occupying excessive space. This placement creates balance and proportion, centralizing the focus on the seating area and complementing the fabric L-shaped sofa.

The sleek TV stand is positioned against the north wall, facing the south wall, directly opposite the sofa. Measuring 1.5 meters in length, 0.4 meters in width, and 0.5 meters in height, it fits comfortably without obstructing pathways or the view from the sofa. This placement ensures a direct line of sight for viewers seated on the sofa, maintaining a cohesive and chic room design.

A teal decorative cushion is placed on the L-shaped sofa, providing decorative comfort and a color accent. Its dimensions are 0.5 meters in length, 0.5 meters in width, and 0.15 meters in height, making it suitable for sofa placement without obstructing seating space or aesthetic.

The modern ceramic vase is placed on the marble coffee table, serving as a decorative centerpiece. With dimensions of 0.196 meters in length, 0.196 meters in width, and 0.328 meters in height, it fits comfortably on the table, enhancing the aesthetic appeal by adding a focal point to the coffee table area.

The soundbar is placed on top of the TV stand along the north wall, adjacent and directly in front of the TV stand. Its dimensions are 0.9 meters in length, 0.1 meters in width, and 0.1 meters in height, allowing it to fit comfortably without obstructing the TV screen or aesthetic balance. This placement ensures optimal audio delivery and maintains both functionality and aesthetic cohesion in the room.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified regarding the placement of multiple decorative items on the sofa, specifically cushion_1, cushion_2, and throw_1. The area of the sofa was too small to accommodate all these objects simultaneously. To resolve this, cushion_2 and throw_1 were removed based on their lower functional priority compared to cushion_1, which provides a necessary pop of color and decorative comfort while maintaining the chic aesthetic of the room.
