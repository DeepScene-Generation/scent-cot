## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user has specified the need for a professional home office, emphasizing the importance of a large desk, a swivel chair, and a bookcase as central elements for a lawyer's work environment. The room is described as having a minimalist and professional aesthetic with neutral tones, suggesting additional objects should maintain this design philosophy. The user's preferences highlight three main areas: a desk area with ergonomic seating, a bookcase area for organized storage, and an open space for movement. To enhance functionality and aesthetics, the room would benefit from additional objects such as a desk lamp for lighting, a file cabinet for document organization, a computer monitor for digital work, and a rug to enhance the professional ambiance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is decomposed into three primary substructures based on user requirements. The Desk Area is the focal point, designed for work and equipped with ergonomic seating. The Bookcase Area is intended for organized storage, ensuring easy access to books and materials. Lastly, the Open Movement Space is crucial for maintaining a spacious and uncluttered environment, allowing for free movement and contributing to the room's professional aesthetic.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Desk Area, a modern wooden desk measuring 2.0 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended, accompanied by a leather swivel chair (0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.0 meter) for ergonomic seating. A desk lamp (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters) and a computer monitor (0.5 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.4 meters) are suggested to enhance functionality. The Bookcase Area features a modern wooden bookcase (1.2 meters by 0.3 meters by 2.0 meters) for organized storage. A file cabinet (0.4 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.7 meters) is recommended for efficient document organization. A neutral-colored rug (2.0 meters by 1.5 meters) is proposed to define the workspace area, while a minimalist clock (0.3 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.3 meters) is suggested for time management. Additional accessories include a notebook for note-taking and a cushion for added comfort on the swivel chair.

## 4. Scene Graph
The desk is placed against the north wall, facing it, to maximize natural light exposure and adhere to the user's preference for a large, functional workspace. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.8m x 0.75m) allow it to serve as the central element of the office, providing ample space for work-related activities. The swivel chair is positioned behind the desk, facing it, ensuring ergonomic alignment for working at the desk. This placement allows for easy access to the desk while maintaining a professional and functional layout. The bookcase is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, ensuring easy access to books and maintaining balance in the room's layout. Its modern style complements the desk and chair, contributing to a cohesive aesthetic. The desk lamp is placed on the desk, facing the north wall, providing necessary lighting without overwhelming the workspace. The file cabinet is positioned to the right of the desk, facing the north wall, allowing for easy access to files while maintaining the room's professional aesthetic. The computer monitor is placed on the desk, adjacent to the desk lamp, facing the north wall, optimizing the functionality of the home office setup. The rug is placed under the desk and swivel chair, aligning with the desk's position against the north wall, providing a defined workspace area. The waste bin is placed to the left of the desk, adjacent to the rug, facing the north wall, ensuring accessibility and maintaining the room's aesthetic and functional balance. The notebook is placed on the right side of the desk, adjacent to the computer monitor, facing the north wall, ensuring easy accessibility and maintaining the desk's organized appearance. The cushion is placed on the swivel chair, enhancing comfort without altering the room's design or functionality. The clock is mounted on the north wall above the desk, facing the south wall, ensuring it is clearly visible and accessible for time management purposes.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the initial placement of the swivel chair in front of the desk, as it would be placed out of bounds. To resolve this, the swivel chair was repositioned behind the desk, facing it, ensuring ergonomic alignment and maintaining the room's professional layout. Additionally, the desk area was too small to accommodate all objects, leading to the removal of the pen holder, which was deemed the least important for the user's preference and the room's functionality. This adjustment ensured the room maintained its professional aesthetic while optimizing functionality.
