## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a personal gym room designed for various workouts, including strength training with dumbbells, yoga, and stretching. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, is intended to accommodate a dumbbell rack, a yoga mat, and a wall-mounted mirror. The user emphasizes the need for designated areas for each activity, ensuring functionality and ergonomic standards. Additional items such as a workout bench, resistance bands, a stability ball, and a wall clock are suggested to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetics, creating a motivating and energizing atmosphere.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into specific zones to meet the user's requirements. The Strength Training Area is along the south wall, designated for the dumbbell rack and sets, ensuring easy access and organization. The Yoga and Stretching Area is centrally located, providing ample space for movement and exercises on the yoga mat. The Posture Monitoring Area is facilitated by a wall-mounted mirror on the east wall, allowing users to check their form during workouts. Additional zones include a space for the workout bench along the north wall and a timekeeping area on the west wall for the wall clock.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Strength Training Area, a modern metal dumbbell rack (1.0m x 0.5m x 1.0m) and three dumbbell sets (each 0.3m x 0.3m x 0.3m) are recommended. The Yoga and Stretching Area features a minimalist rubber yoga mat (1.8m x 0.6m x 0.02m) placed centrally. A modern glass wall mirror (2.0m x 0.05m x 1.8m) is suggested for the Posture Monitoring Area on the east wall. A modern metal workout bench (1.2m x 0.4m x 0.5m) is proposed for the north wall, and a modern metal wall clock (0.4m x 0.05m x 0.4m) is recommended for the west wall. Resistance bands (0.054m x 0.058m x 0.2m) are included for additional strength training exercises.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dumbbell rack is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to organize dumbbells while keeping the central area open for other activities. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.5m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, maintaining balance and proportion in the room. The dumbbell sets are placed on the floor adjacent to the rack, ensuring easy access and a tidy setup. Each set measures 0.3m x 0.3m x 0.3m, complementing the rack's functionality and aesthetic.

The yoga mat is centrally placed in the room, oriented along the east-west axis, providing ample space for stretching exercises. Its dimensions (1.8m x 0.6m x 0.02m) ensure it does not obstruct other objects, maintaining an open and functional workout area. The wall mirror is mounted on the east wall, facing the west wall, allowing users to monitor their posture during exercises. Its size (2.0m x 0.05m x 1.8m) fits well on the wall, enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The workout bench is positioned on the north wall, facing the south wall, left of the yoga mat. This placement ensures access to the dumbbells and visibility of the mirror, supporting a functional gym layout. The bench's dimensions (1.2m x 0.4m x 0.5m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, maintaining balance and proportion. Resistance bands are placed on the floor in the middle of the room, adjacent to the yoga mat, ensuring they are easily accessible for workout sessions.

Finally, the wall clock is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, ensuring visibility throughout the room. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.05m x 0.4m) are proportionate to the wall, enhancing the gym's functionality by allowing users to track time during workouts.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified regarding the placement of the yoga mat, which was too small to accommodate both the workout bench and the stability ball left of it. To resolve this, the stability ball was removed, as it was deemed less critical compared to the workout bench, which is essential for strength training exercises. This adjustment ensures the room remains functional and aligned with the user's preference for a personal gym with a set of dumbbells, a yoga mat, and a wall-mounted mirror.

    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with parent
        - calculation:
            - Rotation of wall_clock_1: 90.0°
            - Rotation of west_wall: 90.0°
            - Rotation difference: |90.0 - 90.0| = 0.0°
        - conclusion: Using width dimension for directional constraint
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'west_wall' relation
        - calculation:
            - wall_clock_1 size: 0.4 (length)
            - Cluster size (west_wall): max(0.0, 0.4) = 0.4
        - conclusion: wall_clock_1 cluster size (west_wall): 0.4
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'west_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - wall_clock_1 size: length=0.4, width=0.05, height=0.4
            - x_min = 0 + 0.0/2 + 0.05/2 = 0.025
            - x_max = 0 + 0.0/2 + 0.05/2 = 0.025
            - y_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 0.4/2 = 0.2
            - y_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 0.4/2 = 4.8
            - z_min = 1.5 - 3.0/2 + 0.4/2 = 0.2
            - z_max = 1.5 + 3.0/2 - 0.4/2 = 2.8
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.025, 0.025, 0.2, 4.8, 0.2, 2.8)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.025-0.025), y(0.2-4.8)
            - Final coordinates: x=0.025, y=0.4296, z=0.4832
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.025, y: 0.4296, z: 0.4832
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No other objects in proximity
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=0.025, y=0.4296, z=0.4832
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.025, y: 0.4296, z: 0.4832
