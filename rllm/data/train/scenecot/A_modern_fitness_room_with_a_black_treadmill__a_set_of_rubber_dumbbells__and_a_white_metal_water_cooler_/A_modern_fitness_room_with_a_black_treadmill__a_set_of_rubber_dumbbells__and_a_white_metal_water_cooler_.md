## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern fitness room with specific requirements, including a black treadmill, a set of rubber dumbbells, and a white metal water cooler. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary focus is on facilitating cardiovascular exercise, strength training, and easy access to hydration. Additionally, the user desires an open space for flexibility and stretching exercises. To enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic, additional items such as a gym mat, a large mirror, and a wall clock are recommended. These items support stretching exercises, aid in maintaining proper form, and help track workout durations, respectively. The overall design aims to balance functionality, safety, and a modern aesthetic.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on user requirements. The Treadmill Area is designated along the south wall for cardiovascular exercise. The Dumbbell Area is positioned along the east wall for strength training, ensuring accessibility and safety. The Hydration Station is located along the west wall, providing easy access to water. The Open Exercise Space is in the center of the room, reserved for stretching and flexibility exercises. Additional elements include a Mirror Area on the north wall for form monitoring and a Clock Area on the east wall for time tracking.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Treadmill Area, a modern black treadmill with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 0.8 meters by 1.5 meters is recommended. In the Dumbbell Area, a set of modern rubber dumbbells measuring 0.935 meters by 0.935 meters by 0.195 meters is proposed. The Hydration Station features a modern white metal water cooler with dimensions of 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.2 meters. The Open Exercise Space includes a minimalist blue foam gym mat measuring 1.8 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.02 meters. The Mirror Area is equipped with a large modern glass mirror measuring 2.0 meters by 0.1 meters by 1.8 meters. Finally, the Clock Area features a modern silver metal wall clock with dimensions of 0.3 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.3 meters.

## 4. Scene Graph
The treadmill is a central component of the fitness room, requiring ample space for safe use. It is placed along the south wall, facing the north wall, to maximize open floor space and ensure sufficient clearance on all sides. This placement aligns with user preferences for a modern fitness room, utilizing the available space efficiently and adhering to design principles. The treadmill's dimensions are 2.0 meters in length, 0.8 meters in width, and 1.5 meters in height.

The dumbbell set, essential for strength training, is placed along the east wall, facing the west wall. This location keeps the dumbbells accessible without interfering with the treadmill and maintains a clean layout. The dumbbell set's dimensions are 0.935 meters in length, 0.935 meters in width, and 0.195 meters in height.

The water cooler, serving the function of hydration, is placed along the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement keeps it out of the main workout area in the middle of the room and maintains a sense of balance in the room's layout. The water cooler's dimensions are 0.4 meters in length, 0.4 meters in width, and 1.2 meters in height.

The gym mat, intended for stretching and flexibility exercises, is placed in the middle of the room. This ensures it remains accessible and usable without interference from other objects. The gym mat's dimensions are 1.8 meters in length, 0.6 meters in width, and 0.02 meters in height.

The large mirror, essential for monitoring form during exercises, is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement allows users on the treadmill and those using dumbbells to easily monitor their form. The mirror's dimensions are 2.0 meters in length, 0.1 meters in width, and 1.8 meters in height.

The wall clock, used for time tracking, is placed on the east wall above the dumbbell set, facing the west wall. This placement ensures it does not interfere with the functionality of other objects and remains visible. The clock's dimensions are 0.3 meters in length, 0.05 meters in width, and 0.3 meters in height.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed in a manner that respects the user's vision of a modern fitness room, adhering to design principles of balance and proportion. The layout supports effective workouts by maintaining functionality and aesthetic alignment with the room's modern theme.
