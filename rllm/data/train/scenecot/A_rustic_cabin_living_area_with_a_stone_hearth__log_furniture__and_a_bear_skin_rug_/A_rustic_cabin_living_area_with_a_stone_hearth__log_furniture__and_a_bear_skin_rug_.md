## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a rustic cabin living area that emphasizes warmth and an inviting atmosphere through natural elements. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for essential furniture and decorative elements. The central focus is a stone hearth on the south wall, serving as both a visual anchor and a source of warmth. The user desires a seating area with log furniture, including a sofa and armchairs, to create a central gathering space. Additional elements such as a bear skin rug, wrought iron lighting fixtures, and exposed wooden beams are requested to enhance the rustic aesthetic and maintain a cozy ambiance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Hearth Area is the focal point, centered around the stone hearth on the north wall. The Seating Area is arranged around the hearth, featuring log furniture to provide a comfortable gathering space. The Flooring Area includes a bear skin rug in the center of the room, enhancing the rustic aesthetic. The Lighting Area is defined by wrought iron fixtures that provide ambient lighting, while the Ceiling Area features exposed wooden beams that contribute to the rustic charm and structural stability.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Hearth Area, a stone hearth measuring 1.8 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.2 meters is recommended as the central focal point. The Seating Area includes a log sofa (2.0 meters by 0.9 meters by 1.0 meters) and a log armchair (0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 1.0 meters) to provide comfortable seating. The Flooring Area features a bear skin rug (2.0 meters by 1.5 meters) to enhance the rustic aesthetic. The Lighting Area includes a wrought iron fixture (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.8 meters) for ambient lighting. The Ceiling Area is adorned with a wooden beam (5.0 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters) to add structural and decorative interest.

## 4. Scene Graph
The stone hearth is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, to serve as the central focal point of the rustic living area. Its dimensions (1.8m x 0.6m x 1.2m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, maximizing visibility and allowing furniture to be arranged around it. This placement aligns with the typical setup in cabin designs, where the hearth is often a centerpiece, providing warmth and serving as a visual anchor.

The log sofa is positioned on the south wall, facing the north wall where the stone hearth is located. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.9m x 1.0m) fit comfortably along the wall, providing a direct line of sight to the hearth. This placement ensures the sofa complements the rustic theme, offering a cozy seating arrangement that enhances the room's warmth and aesthetic appeal.

The log armchair is placed to the left of the log sofa, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.8m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably beside the sofa, maintaining a clear view of the stone hearth. This placement supports the rustic theme, providing additional seating and maintaining harmony with the existing furniture layout.

The bear skin rug is placed in the middle of the room, serving as a decorative and functional centerpiece. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m) allow it to fit comfortably in the center without overlapping the furniture, maintaining clear pathways and enhancing the rustic aesthetic.

The wrought iron fixture is placed on the ceiling, centrally above the bear skin rug, providing ambient lighting to the entire room. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.8m) ensure it does not interfere with floor-based furniture, complementing the rustic theme and enhancing the room's cozy atmosphere.

The wooden beam is placed on the ceiling, running horizontally from the east wall to the west wall. Its dimensions (5.0m x 0.3m x 0.3m) allow it to span the room's width, contributing to the rustic design and serving as a decorative ceiling element without interfering with existing objects or the overall room layout.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the length of the south wall being too small to accommodate all the intended objects, including the log sofa and two log armchairs. To resolve this, one of the log armchairs (log_armchair_2) was removed, as it was deemed the least important for maintaining the room's functionality and user preference for a rustic cabin living area. This adjustment ensures the remaining furniture fits comfortably along the south wall, maintaining the room's aesthetic and functional goals.
