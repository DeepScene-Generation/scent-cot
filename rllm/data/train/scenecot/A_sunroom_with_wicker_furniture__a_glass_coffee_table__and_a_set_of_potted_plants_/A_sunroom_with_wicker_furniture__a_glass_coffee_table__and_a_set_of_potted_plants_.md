## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a sunroom characterized by wicker furniture, a glass coffee table, and a collection of potted plants. The room is designed to emphasize relaxation, natural light, and a connection with outdoor elements. The dimensions of the room are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters. The user prefers a natural and airy style, with a focus on functionality and aesthetic appeal, ensuring the room does not feel overcrowded. The maximum number of objects should not exceed nine to maintain optimal design and functionality.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on user requirements. The Seating Area is located along the south wall, featuring wicker furniture to provide comfort and enhance the natural ambiance. The Central Area is designated for the glass coffee table, serving as a focal point for relaxation and leisure activities. The Decorative Area includes the placement of potted plants, strategically positioned to enhance the room's natural aesthetic and maintain a connection with nature.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a bohemian-style wicker sofa and two wicker armchairs are recommended, providing comfortable seating and complementing the room's natural theme. The Central Area features a contemporary glass coffee table, which serves as a functional spot for beverages and reading materials. In the Decorative Area, a variety of potted plants are suggested to introduce greenery and promote a connection with nature, ensuring optimal sunlight exposure and visual interest.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wicker sofa, a larger piece of furniture, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement optimizes space and provides a clear line of sight across the room, enhancing the sunroom experience by maximizing sunlight exposure. The sofa's dimensions are 1.8 meters in length, 0.8 meters in width, and 0.75 meters in height, fitting comfortably along the south wall without spatial conflicts. The placement aligns with the user's preference for a sunroom with wicker furniture, adhering to design principles by balancing the room's layout.

The first wicker armchair is placed to the right of the wicker sofa, also against the south wall, facing the north wall. With dimensions of 0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.75 meters, it complements the sofa's placement, creating a cohesive seating area. This arrangement supports the seating area's social function, maintaining balance and scale within the room.

The glass coffee table is centrally placed in front of the wicker sofa, facing the north wall. Its dimensions are 1.31 meters in length, 0.787 meters in width, and 0.409 meters in height. This central placement allows easy access from the seating area, serving as a functional spot for beverages and reading materials. The table's transparency and sleek design contribute to the room's aesthetic appeal, integrating contemporary and bohemian styles harmoniously.

Potted plant 2 is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions are 0.3 meters in length, 0.3 meters in width, and 0.6 meters in height. This placement enhances the room's greenery without obstructing pathways or overcrowding the space, aligning with the user's preference for a natural sunroom aesthetic.

Potted plant 3 is positioned on the north wall, right of potted plant 2, facing the south wall. With dimensions of 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.5 meters, it maintains symmetry with the arrangement on the south wall, enhancing the room's aesthetic balance. This placement ensures no overcrowding of the south wall, where most seating furniture is placed.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to the limited space on the south wall and the small width of potted plant 2. The south wall could not accommodate all intended objects, leading to the removal of the side table and one of the wicker armchairs to maintain functionality and aesthetic appeal. Additionally, potted plant 4 was deleted to resolve the spatial conflict with potted plant 2, ensuring the room remains balanced and visually pleasing.
