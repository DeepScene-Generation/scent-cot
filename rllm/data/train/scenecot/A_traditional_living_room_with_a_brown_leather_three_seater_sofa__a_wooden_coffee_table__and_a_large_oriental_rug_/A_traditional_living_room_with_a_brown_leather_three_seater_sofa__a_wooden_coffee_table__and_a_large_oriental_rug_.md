## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a traditional living room that emphasizes comfort and elegance, featuring a brown leather sofa, a wooden coffee table, and an oriental rug. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary focus is on creating a balanced seating arrangement that includes a central table area and an overall ambiance that aligns with traditional aesthetics. Additional seating options, such as armchairs, and decor elements like cushions and a throw blanket, are considered to enhance the room's functionality and visual appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The living room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Seating Area is anchored by the three-seater sofa, complemented by two armchairs to create a cozy conversation zone. The Central Table Area features the wooden coffee table, serving as the focal point for the seating arrangement. The Lighting Area includes a floor lamp to provide ambient lighting, enhancing the room's traditional aesthetic. The Decorative Area incorporates cushions and a throw blanket to add texture and warmth. Lastly, the Media Area is designated for a media console, providing storage and display space.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a traditional brown leather sofa (2.0m x 0.9m x 0.8m) is recommended, along with two beige fabric armchairs (each 0.8m x 0.8m x 1.0m) to complement the sofa. The Central Table Area features a dark brown wooden coffee table (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.45m). In the Lighting Area, a bronze metal floor lamp (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.8m) is suggested to provide a warm glow. The Decorative Area includes a red fabric cushion (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m) to accent the sofa. Finally, the Media Area features a dark brown wooden media console (1.5m x 0.5m x 0.7m) for storage and display.

## 4. Scene Graph
The sofa, a central element of the traditional living room, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement anchors the room and provides a focal point, allowing for a natural flow and easy arrangement of other furniture. The sofa's dimensions (2.0m x 0.9m x 0.8m) fit comfortably against the 5.0-meter-wide wall, leaving space for additional furniture. The armchair_1 is positioned to the left of the sofa, facing the east wall, creating a cohesive seating area. Its placement ensures easy conversation flow and access to the coffee table. Armchair_2 is symmetrically placed to the right of the sofa, facing the west wall, enhancing the traditional aesthetic and balance in the room.

The coffee table is centrally placed in front of the sofa, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.45m) allow it to fit without obstructing movement, providing a functional surface for items while seated. The side table is placed to the right of the sofa, adjacent to it, against the north wall, facing the east wall. This placement ensures easy access to the surface from the sofa and enhances the room's symmetry and functionality. The oriental rug, measuring 3.5m x 2.5m, is placed in the middle of the room, under the coffee table and partially extending under the sofa and armchairs. This placement enhances the traditional aesthetic while providing a functional and visually appealing floor covering.

The floor lamp is placed adjacent to armchair_1, positioned to the left of it, facing the north wall. This placement provides functional lighting for the seating area while maintaining visual balance. The cushion is centrally placed on the sofa, facing the south wall, providing a decorative accent to the seating area. Finally, the media console is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, in line with the central position of the coffee table and sofa. This placement provides easy access for storage and display purposes while maintaining aesthetic balance and functionality in the living room layout.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts were identified due to limited space on the sofa and the north wall. The sofa could not accommodate all decorative items, leading to the removal of cushion_2 and throw_blanket_1 to prioritize the user's preference for a traditional living room with a brown leather sofa and a large oriental rug. Additionally, the north wall could not accommodate all intended objects, resulting in the removal of side_table_2 to maintain the room's functionality and aesthetic balance. These adjustments ensured the room remained uncluttered and visually appealing, adhering to the user's traditional style preferences.

For media_console_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No rotation difference calculation needed
        - conclusion: No directional constraint applied
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'south_wall' relation
        - calculation:
            - media_console_1 size: 1.5 (length)
            - Cluster size (south_wall): max(0.0, 1.5) = 1.5
        - conclusion: media_console_1 cluster size (south_wall): 1.5
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'south_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - media_console_1 size: length=1.5, width=0.5, height=0.7
            - x_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 1.5/2 = 0.75
            - x_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 1.5/2 = 4.25
            - y_min = 0 + 0.5/2 = 0.25
            - y_max = 0 + 0.5/2 = 0.25
