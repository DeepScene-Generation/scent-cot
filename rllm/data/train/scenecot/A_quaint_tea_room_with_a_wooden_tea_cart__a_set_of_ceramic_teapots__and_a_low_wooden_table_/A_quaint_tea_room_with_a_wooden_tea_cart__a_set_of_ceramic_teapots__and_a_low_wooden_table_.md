## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a quaint tea room characterized by a warm and inviting atmosphere. Key elements include a wooden tea cart, a set of ceramic teapots, a low wooden table, and a cozy seating area with cushions. Additionally, there is a need for a shelf to store teas and teacups, as well as tea-themed artwork to enhance the aesthetic appeal. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for these elements while maintaining a traditional style.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main areas based on user requirements: the Tea Preparation and Display Area, the Seating Area with a Low Table, and the Tea Set Storage and Display Area. The Tea Preparation and Display Area is designed for the tea cart and related items, facilitating easy access for tea preparation. The Seating Area, centered around the low table, is intended for social interaction and relaxation. The Tea Set Storage and Display Area, featuring a shelf, is designated for organizing and showcasing tea-related items.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Tea Preparation and Display Area, a traditional wooden tea cart is recommended, along with classic ceramic teapots and teacups. The Seating Area includes a low wooden table and traditional fabric cushions in various colors to create a cozy gathering spot. The Tea Set Storage and Display Area features a traditional wooden tea shelf for storing and displaying tea items. Additionally, tea-themed artwork and an oriental-style ceiling lantern are suggested to enhance the room's aesthetic and provide ambient lighting.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden tea cart is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to facilitate tea preparation and serving. Its dimensions are 1.0 meters in length, 0.5 meters in width, and 0.9 meters in height. This placement maintains an open feel and aligns with the traditional style, ensuring functional access to the tea preparation area.

The ceramic teapot is placed on the tea cart, facing the north wall, to facilitate easy access during tea preparation. Its dimensions are 0.24 meters in length, 0.158 meters in width, and 0.152 meters in height. This placement maintains the user's vision of a quaint tea room setup and complements the tea cart's functionality.

The low wooden table, measuring 1.2 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.4 meters, is centrally positioned in the room to serve as a gathering and serving area. This central placement aligns with the user's preference for a traditional aesthetic and provides adequate space for movement and interaction.

Cushion 1, with dimensions of 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.1 meters, is placed in front of the low table, facing the north wall. This placement creates a cozy seating area around the table, enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

Cushion 2, identical in size to Cushion 1, is placed behind the low table, facing the north wall. This placement maintains balance and symmetry in the seating arrangement, aligning with the traditional aesthetic.

Cushion 3, also measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.1 meters, is placed to the right of the low table, facing the north wall. This placement completes the seating arrangement around the table, ensuring comfortable seating and promoting interaction.

The tea shelf, measuring 1.15 meters by 0.398 meters by 2.152 meters, is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement ensures stability and accessibility for storing and displaying tea items, contributing to the room's aesthetic and functional purpose.

The teacup is placed on the tea cart, facing the north wall, alongside the ceramic teapots. Its dimensions are 0.04 meters by 0.051 meters by 0.056 meters. This placement maintains a cohesive and functional tea preparation area, aligning with the user's vision.

The tea artwork, measuring 1.0 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.6 meters, is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement provides a decorative focal point, enhancing the room's traditional and quaint atmosphere.

The ceiling lantern, with dimensions of 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.5 meters, is centrally placed on the ceiling, facing downward. This placement provides balanced lighting for the main gathering area, complementing the room's traditional decor.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the tea cart's capacity to accommodate all intended objects. The area was too small for ceramic teapot 1, ceramic teapot 2, teacup 1, and teacup 2. To resolve this, teacup 2 was removed, as it was deemed the least important for maintaining the room's functionality and user preference for a quaint tea room with a wooden tea cart, ceramic teapots, and a low wooden table. This resolution ensures the tea cart remains functional and aesthetically aligned with the user's vision.
