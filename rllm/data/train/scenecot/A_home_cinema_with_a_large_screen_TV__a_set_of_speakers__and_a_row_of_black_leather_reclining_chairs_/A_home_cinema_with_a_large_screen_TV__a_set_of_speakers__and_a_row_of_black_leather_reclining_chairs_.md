## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a home cinema setup within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters by 3.0 meters. The primary components include a large screen TV, strategically placed speakers for surround sound, and a row of reclining chairs for comfort. The north wall is designated for the TV to serve as the central visual focus. The user emphasizes the importance of an immersive audio experience, necessitating careful speaker placement. Reclining chairs are essential for comfort and viewing, and a control system area is suggested for convenience. The aesthetic goal is a cohesive, modern look with dim lighting to enhance the theater-like atmosphere.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The TV Display Area on the north wall serves as the visual focal point. The Audio Distribution Area involves strategic placement of speakers on the west, east, and south walls to ensure balanced sound. The Seating Area on the south wall is designed for a row of reclining chairs facing the TV. Additionally, a Control System Area is proposed near the seating for easy access to remotes and control devices. These substructures collectively create an immersive home cinema environment.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the TV Display Area, a modern-style large screen TV with dimensions of 1.5 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.9 meters is recommended. The Audio Distribution Area includes four modern plastic speakers, each measuring 0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 1.0 meter, placed strategically around the room. The Seating Area features three modern black leather reclining chairs, each 0.9 meters by 0.9 meters by 1.0 meter, to provide comfort and optimal viewing. A small control table is suggested for the Control System Area to hold remotes and control devices, although it was ultimately removed due to spatial constraints.

## 4. Scene Graph
The large screen TV is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall, serving as the central visual element. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.1m x 0.9m) are proportionate to the room's size, ensuring it is neither overwhelming nor too small. This placement allows ample space for the reclining chairs and speakers, aligning with the user's cinema-like experience preference.

Speaker_1 is positioned on the west wall, facing the east wall, to provide balanced sound distribution. Its dimensions (0.2m x 0.2m x 1.0m) ensure it does not obstruct views while delivering effective audio output. Speaker_2 is placed symmetrically on the east wall, facing the west wall, complementing speaker_1 for even sound distribution. Speaker_4 is placed on the north wall, slightly to the right of the TV, facing the south wall, to enhance the surround sound experience without obstructing the TV.

Reclining_chair_1 is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, directly in front of the TV. Its dimensions (0.9m x 0.9m x 1.0m) allow for comfortable viewing without interfering with the speakers. Reclining_chair_2 is placed adjacent to reclining_chair_1, maintaining a cohesive row of seating. Reclining_chair_3 was initially planned to complete the row but was removed due to spatial constraints.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited length of the south wall, which could not accommodate all planned objects, including the control table and the third reclining chair. To resolve this, the control table and reclining_chair_3 were removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a row of reclining chairs and maintaining the essential elements of the home cinema setup. This adjustment ensured the room remained functional and aesthetically aligned with the user's vision.
