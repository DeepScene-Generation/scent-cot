## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a library room that emphasizes a spacious bookcase and a cozy reading chair. The room should include a ceiling light fixture and an open area to foster a quiet environment. The room's dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user desires a harmonious color scheme and decor that promotes relaxation, with a total object count not exceeding 12 to maintain both functionality and aesthetics.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures. The Bookcase Area on the south wall serves as the primary storage for books. The Reading Area, located centrally, is designed for comfort and accessibility, featuring a reading chair and accompanying elements. The Lighting Area, with a ceiling light fixture, ensures adequate illumination. Additional elements like a side table and rug enhance the cozy reading nook, while wall art and a plant contribute to the room's aesthetic appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Bookcase Area, a large wooden bookcase with dimensions of 3.0 meters by 0.4 meters by 2.5 meters is recommended. The Reading Area features a modern navy blue fabric armchair (0.9 meters by 0.9 meters by 1.0 meter) and a white wooden side table (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.6 meters). A minimalist beige wool rug (2.0 meters by 1.5 meters) adds comfort underfoot. The Lighting Area includes a contemporary silver metal ceiling light (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters). Wall art on canvas (0.95 meters by 0.02 meters by 1.4 meters) and a green plant in a ceramic pot (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter) enhance the decor, while a modern black metal floor lamp (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.8 meters) provides additional lighting.

## 4. Scene Graph
The bookcase is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, to serve as a focal point and provide ample storage space. Its dimensions (3.0m x 0.4m x 2.5m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing pathways, aligning with the user's preference for a library setting. The reading chair is centrally located, facing the south wall, to ensure easy access to the bookcase and maintain an open, inviting space. Its dimensions (0.9m x 0.9m x 1.0m) support a cozy reading experience. The ceiling light is centrally placed on the ceiling, facing downwards, to provide even illumination throughout the room, enhancing both the bookcase and reading chair areas. The side table is positioned to the right of the reading chair, facing the south wall, offering convenience for placing items while reading. Its compact size (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.6m) ensures it does not obstruct movement. The rug is placed under the reading chair and side table, unifying the reading zone visually and functionally. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m) fit comfortably without obstructing other elements. Wall art is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, at eye level for seated individuals, adding visual interest without overwhelming the space. The plant is placed on the floor to the left of the reading chair, enhancing the cozy reading corner without causing spatial conflicts. Finally, the floor lamp is positioned to the left of the reading chair, facing the south wall, providing functional lighting for reading activities without interfering with other objects.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were positioned to avoid spatial conflicts, maintain balance, and adhere to the user's vision of a cozy library environment. The arrangement ensures functionality and aesthetic appeal, with each element complementing the overall design.
