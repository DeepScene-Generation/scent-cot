## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern home office within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary furniture pieces include a white and wood desk, a black ergonomic chair, and a silver gray metal filing cabinet. The user emphasizes a modern and minimalistic aesthetic, with functional needs for document storage, comfortable seating, an unobstructed workspace, and ample space for movement. The room layout is defined by the south, north, west, and east walls, as well as the middle of the room and the ceiling.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on user requirements. The Desk Area is designated for the desk and chair, serving as the primary workspace. The Filing Cabinet Area is intended for document storage, ensuring easy access without obstructing movement. The Open Movement Area in the center of the room is kept clear to facilitate movement and exercise, aligning with the user's preference for an open and functional space. Additional elements such as a wall-mounted shelf and a rug are incorporated to enhance storage and define the workspace area.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Desk Area, a modern white and wood desk measuring 1.5 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended, paired with a black ergonomic chair measuring 0.557 meters by 0.617 meters by 0.931 meters. The Filing Cabinet Area features a silver gray metal filing cabinet with dimensions of 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.2 meters. A modern desk lamp and a small plant are suggested to enhance the desk's functionality and aesthetic. A wall-mounted shelf measuring 1.0 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.2 meters provides additional storage and display options. A gray rug measuring 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters defines the workspace area, while a minimalist black clock measuring 0.3 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.3 meters ensures functionality and style.

## 4. Scene Graph
The desk is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, as it serves as the central workspace feature. This placement allows for a direct view when sitting and working, aligning with the user's modern home office setup. The desk's dimensions fit well against the south wall, providing ample room for additional furniture. The chair is positioned in front of the desk, facing the south wall, ensuring user comfort and functionality while working. Its dimensions allow it to fit comfortably without interfering with other layout elements.

The filing cabinet is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, to maximize space efficiency and ensure easy access from the desk. This placement maintains balance and proportion in the room, aligning with the user's modern style preference. The desk lamp is placed on the right side of the desk, facing the south wall, providing direct lighting to the workspace without obstructing the seating area. The wall shelf is mounted on the west wall above the desk area, providing storage and display options while maintaining symmetry and visual interest.

The rug is placed on the floor, underneath the chair, and extending towards the desk, defining the workspace area and adding warmth. This placement ensures it does not conflict with the filing cabinet or other objects. The clock is mounted on the north wall, ensuring visibility from the workspace area and aligning with the room's modern aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the placement of the plant and desk lamp on the desk. The desk lamp's width was too small to accommodate the plant beside it, leading to a spatial conflict. To resolve this, the plant was removed, as it was deemed less critical to the user's preference for a modern home office with a focus on functionality and essential furniture pieces. This resolution ensures the workspace remains uncluttered and functional, adhering to the user's modern aesthetic preferences.
