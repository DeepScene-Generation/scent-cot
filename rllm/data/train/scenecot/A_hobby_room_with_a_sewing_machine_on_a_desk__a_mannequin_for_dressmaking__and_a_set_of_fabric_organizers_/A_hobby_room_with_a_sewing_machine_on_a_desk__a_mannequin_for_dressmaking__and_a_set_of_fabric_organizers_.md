## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a hobby room dedicated to sewing and dressmaking, emphasizing the need for specific areas to accommodate a sewing machine, mannequin, and fabric organizers. The room is a square with dimensions of 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters, providing ample space for these activities. The user requires a sewing desk area equipped with a desk, sewing machine, and a comfortable chair for ergonomic support during long sewing sessions. A mannequin zone is essential for displaying and adjusting garments, while a fabric organizer area is needed for storing fabrics, utilizing shelves and bins for organization. The central area should remain open for easy mobility, with a cutting mat suggested for fabric cutting. Additional lighting, such as a task lamp, is recommended to enhance visibility for detailed work, complementing the ceiling lighting.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Sewing Desk Area is designated for the desk, sewing machine, and chair, forming the primary workspace. The Mannequin Zone is allocated for the mannequin, essential for dressmaking tasks. The Fabric Organizer Area includes shelves and bins for fabric storage, ensuring materials are organized by color and texture. The Open Movement Space in the center of the room is kept clear to facilitate easy mobility, with a cutting mat suggested for fabric cutting tasks. Additional lighting is considered to enhance visibility and support detailed sewing work.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sewing Desk Area, a modern-style wooden desk (1.5m x 0.8m x 0.75m) is recommended, along with a modern metal chair (0.6m x 0.6m x 1.0m) for ergonomic seating. A modern metal sewing machine (0.45m x 0.2m x 0.3m) is suggested to be placed on the desk. In the Mannequin Zone, a classic fabric mannequin (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.7m) is proposed for dressmaking. The Fabric Organizer Area includes a modern wooden fabric shelf (1.2m x 0.4m x 1.8m) and a modern plastic fabric bin (0.6m x 0.4m x 0.4m) for additional storage. A task lamp is recommended for the desk to provide focused lighting, although it was later removed due to space constraints.

## 4. Scene Graph
The desk is placed against the north wall, facing south, forming the primary sewing workspace. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.8m x 0.75m) fit well along the wall, leaving ample space for movement and additional objects. This placement maximizes space and utility, ensuring stability and accessibility to power outlets. The sewing machine is placed on the desk, facing the south wall, ensuring the user has a clear view and access while working. Its dimensions (0.45m x 0.2m x 0.3m) fit well within the desk's available space, maintaining an organized and functional hobby room. The chair is positioned in front of the desk, facing the south wall, allowing the user to sit comfortably and use the sewing machine. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing movement.

The mannequin is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, allowing for 360-degree access, crucial for dressmaking tasks. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.7m) ensure it does not block pathways or access to other objects. The fabric shelf is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, providing easy access from the desk and chair area without blocking the main workspace. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.4m x 1.8m) ensure it is accessible yet unobtrusive. The fabric bin is placed on the floor, against the south wall, left of the fabric shelf, allowing for functional access to both the sewing station and fabric storage. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.4m x 0.4m) ensure it does not interfere with the chair or the path to the sewing machine.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, a conflict was identified: the desk area was too small to accommodate all intended objects, including the sewing machine, cutting mat, and task lamp. To resolve this, the task lamp and cutting mat were removed based on their lower functional priority compared to the sewing machine and the need to maintain an organized and functional workspace. This decision ensured the room's layout remained balanced and proportionate, adhering to the user's preferences and functional requirements.
