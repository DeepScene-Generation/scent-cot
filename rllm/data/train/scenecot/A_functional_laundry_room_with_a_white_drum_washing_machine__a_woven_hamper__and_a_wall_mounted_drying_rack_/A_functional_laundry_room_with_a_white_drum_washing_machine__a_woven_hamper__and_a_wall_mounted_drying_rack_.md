## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user has requested the design of a functional laundry room with specific elements, including a white drum washing machine, a woven hamper, and a wall-mounted drying rack. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes the need for open maneuvering space to facilitate easy movement and efficient laundry tasks. Additional recommendations include a detergent storage solution, a utility cart for organizing laundry essentials, and a folding ironing board, all while maintaining a minimalist aesthetic.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to accommodate the user's requirements. The Washing Machine Area is designated for the washing machine, ensuring it is easily accessible and connected to plumbing and electrical outlets. The Laundry Hamper Area is positioned near the washing machine for convenience. The Drying Rack Wall is allocated for the wall-mounted drying rack, optimizing space for air-drying clothes. The Open Maneuvering Space is crucial for facilitating movement and performing laundry tasks efficiently. Additional areas include space for detergent storage and a utility cart, enhancing the room's functionality.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Washing Machine Area, a modern white drum washing machine with dimensions of 0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.85 meters is recommended. The Laundry Hamper Area features a minimalist woven hamper measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.7 meters. The Drying Rack Wall includes a modern metal drying rack, 1.2 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.1 meters, mounted on the wall. A modern plastic detergent storage unit, 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.5 meters, is suggested for placement on the washing machine. A minimalist metal utility cart, 0.6 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.8 meters, is recommended for organizing essentials. Finally, a modern metal ironing board, 1.3 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.1 meters, is proposed for the Open Maneuvering Space.

## 4. Scene Graph
The washing machine is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, as it is a key component of the laundry room. This placement allows for proper plumbing and electrical connections and ensures easy access from the room's entrance. The washing machine's dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.85m) fit well against the wall, leaving ample space for other elements. The woven hamper is positioned to the right of the washing machine on the south wall, maintaining functional proximity for transferring clothes. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.7m) ensure it fits without spatial conflict, keeping the room organized and functional.

The drying rack is mounted on the east wall, facing the west wall, allowing easy access from the washing machine and hamper. Its elongated shape (1.2m x 0.3m x 0.1m) fits well along the wall, and its white color complements the washing machine, enhancing the room's aesthetic. The detergent storage is placed on top of the washing machine, providing easy access during laundry tasks. Its small size (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.5m) fits comfortably without obstructing the washing machine's functionality.

The utility cart is placed on the east wall, left of the drying rack, facing the west wall. This placement ensures it is accessible for organizing laundry essentials without blocking pathways. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.3m x 0.8m) fit well against the wall, maintaining balance and proportion. The ironing board is placed in the middle of the room, facing the north wall, providing easy access from both the drying rack and washing machine. Its placement ensures an open, maneuverable space for ironing tasks, with dimensions of 1.3 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.1 meters.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The room's layout accommodates all objects without spatial conflicts, ensuring a functional and aesthetically pleasing laundry room. The placement of each object aligns with user preferences and design principles, maintaining an open and organized space.
