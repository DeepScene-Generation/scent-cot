## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions an elegant foyer characterized by classic elements, including a wooden console table, a decorative mirror, and a chic ceramic vase. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user desires a sophisticated ambiance with functional and aesthetic elements such as a chandelier for ambient lighting, a rug to define the space, and wall sconces to enhance symmetry and elegance. The foyer should remain uncluttered, with a maximum of nine objects to maintain its elegance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The foyer is divided into several key substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The South Wall Area is designated for the console table, mirror, and decorative elements, serving as the main focal point. The Ceiling Area is intended for the chandelier, providing ambient lighting. The Middle of the Room Area is reserved for the rug, adding texture and defining the space. The South Wall also accommodates wall sconces for additional lighting and symmetry, while the entrance area includes an umbrella stand for practicality.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the South Wall Area, a classic wooden console table (1.2m x 0.4m x 0.8m) is recommended, accompanied by a decorative mirror (0.9m x 0.05m x 1.0m) and a chic ceramic vase (0.25m x 0.25m x 0.5m). The Ceiling Area features a classic chandelier (0.8m x 0.8m x 0.6m) to provide ambient lighting. A classic wool rug (2.0m x 1.5m) is suggested for the Middle of the Room Area. Classic metal wall sconces (0.14m x 0.065m x 0.151m) are recommended for the South Wall to enhance lighting and symmetry. An umbrella stand (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.7m) is proposed near the entrance for functionality.

## 4. Scene Graph
The console table is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, as it serves as the focal point of the foyer. Its classic style and dimensions (1.2m x 0.4m x 0.8m) fit comfortably against the wall, allowing for decorative displays and easy access. This placement aligns with the user's vision of an elegant foyer, maintaining balance and proportion in the room's layout.

The mirror is positioned above the console table on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.9m x 0.05m x 1.0m) ensure it fits well without overwhelming the wall space. This placement enhances the aesthetic appeal and functionality of the space, reflecting light and adding depth.

The ceramic vase is placed on the console table, facing the north wall. Its small size (0.25m x 0.25m x 0.5m) allows it to complement the existing pieces without causing spatial conflicts. This placement ensures the vase is a focal point without obstructing the mirror, aligning with the user's vision for the foyer.

The chandelier is centrally placed on the ceiling, facing downward. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.8m x 0.6m) fit well within the ceiling space, ensuring no spatial conflicts with existing objects. This placement provides optimal light distribution, enhancing the room's elegance and classic style.

The rug is placed in the middle of the room, facing upward. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m) fit comfortably, leaving ample space for movement around the console table and other elements. This placement creates visual balance and contributes to the elegant foyer aesthetic.

Wall sconce 1 is placed on the south wall, centered above the console table and mirror, at a height of 1.5 meters. It faces the north wall, providing elegant lighting that enhances the foyer's classic design without disrupting the existing layout. Wall sconce 2 is symmetrically placed on the south wall, opposite wall sconce 1, ensuring balanced lighting and maintaining the overall aesthetic.

The umbrella stand is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, to the left of the console table. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.7m) allow it to fit beside the console table without overlapping with other objects. This placement provides a convenient spot for umbrellas, complementing the foyer's elegant setup.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose when the console table's surface was found too small to accommodate both the ceramic vase and the decorative bowl. Given the user's preference for an elegant foyer featuring a classic wooden console table, a decorative mirror, and a chic ceramic vase, the decorative bowl was deemed less critical. To resolve this, the decorative bowl was removed, ensuring the console table remains uncluttered and aligned with the user's vision.
