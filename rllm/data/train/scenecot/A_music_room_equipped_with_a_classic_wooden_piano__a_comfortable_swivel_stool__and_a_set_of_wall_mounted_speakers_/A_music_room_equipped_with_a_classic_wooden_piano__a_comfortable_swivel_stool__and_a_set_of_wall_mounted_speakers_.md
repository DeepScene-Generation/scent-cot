## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a music room designed to optimize sound experience, featuring a classic wooden piano, a swivel stool, and wall-mounted speakers. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary focus is on acoustics and aesthetics, with the piano area being critical for music playing and composition. The user desires a classic style, with additional elements like a music stand, area rug, and wall art to enhance functionality and visual appeal. The room should maintain an open middle space to ensure unobstructed sound flow and acoustic clarity.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The music room is divided into several key substructures based on user requirements. The Piano Area is positioned against the south wall to enhance sound resonance. The Seating Area, featuring a swivel stool, is directly in front of the piano for ergonomic seating. The Speaker Setup involves two wall-mounted speakers on the north wall to deliver a high-quality surround sound experience. The Open Space in the middle of the room ensures unobstructed sound flow. Additional substructures include a Music Stand Area adjacent to the piano for easy access to sheet music, an Area Rug for sound absorption and comfort, and a Wall Art Area on the east wall for aesthetic enhancement.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Piano Area, a classic wooden piano measuring 1.5 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.2 meters is recommended. The Seating Area includes a classic swivel stool with dimensions of 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.6 meters. The Speaker Setup features two modern wall-mounted speakers, each measuring 0.3 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters. The Music Stand Area includes a classic metal music stand measuring 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.0 meters. The Area Rug, measuring 2.0 meters by 2.0 meters, is recommended for the central space. Finally, the Wall Art Area features a modern canvas piece measuring 1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 1.0 meter.

## 4. Scene Graph
The classic wooden piano is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement is crucial for sound projection into the room, aligning with the user's preference for a music room setup. The piano's dimensions (1.5m x 0.6m x 1.2m) fit well against the wall, maximizing acoustics and leaving ample space for additional furniture. The swivel stool is positioned directly in front of the piano, facing the south wall. This placement ensures comfortable seating for playing the piano, maintaining aesthetic consistency and functionality. The stool's dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.6m) allow it to fit without obstructing other elements.

Speaker_1 is mounted on the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures optimal sound distribution towards the piano and the center of the room, enhancing the listening experience. Speaker_2 is also mounted on the north wall, maintaining symmetry with speaker_1 for balanced audio output. Both speakers' dimensions (0.3m x 0.2m x 0.5m) ensure they do not interfere with existing furniture. The music stand is placed against the south wall, to the left of the piano, facing the north wall. This placement allows easy access for the musician, maintaining balance and functionality.

The area rug is centrally placed under the swivel stool and partially under the piano. Its dimensions (2.0m x 2.0m) enhance acoustics and comfort without obstructing movement. The rug's dark red color complements the piano's brown wood, adhering to the classic style. Wall_art_1 is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement allows it to be a visual centerpiece, complementing the room's aesthetic without spatial conflicts.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed considering spatial relationships and user preferences, ensuring a cohesive and functional music room design.
