## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a minimalist study room that emphasizes focus and creativity through a calming and uncluttered aesthetic. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements requested include a natural wood desk, a black swivel office chair, and a white wooden bookshelf. The user desires a space that supports ergonomic functionality and maintains a minimalist style, with additional elements like a desk lamp, a small plant, a minimalist clock, and a floor mat for stretching exercises to enhance the room's utility and aesthetic.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to align with the user's minimalist vision. The Workspace Area is designated along the north wall for the desk and chair, providing a focused environment for work. The Storage Area is along the east wall, where the bookshelf is placed to store books and documents. The Lighting Area is integrated into the workspace with a desk lamp for focused illumination. The Decorative Area includes a small plant and a clock to add natural and functional elements. Finally, the Central Open Space is reserved for a floor mat, allowing for movement and stretching exercises.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Workspace Area, a natural wood desk measuring 1.5 meters by 0.7 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended, paired with a black swivel office chair sized at 0.663 meters by 0.683 meters by 0.986 meters. The Storage Area features a white wooden bookshelf with dimensions of 1.0 meter by 0.3 meters by 2.0 meters. The Lighting Area includes a minimalist desk lamp (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters) to provide focused lighting. The Decorative Area suggests a small plant (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.5 meters) and a minimalist clock (0.3 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.3 meters) to enhance the room's aesthetic. The Central Open Space is equipped with a gray floor mat (1.8 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.01 meters) for stretching.

## 4. Scene Graph
The natural wood desk, a central element of the workspace, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This positioning ensures stability and maximizes space, aligning with minimalist design principles. The desk's dimensions (1.5m x 0.7m x 0.75m) allow it to serve as a focal point without overcrowding the room, providing ample space for the chair and other elements.

The black swivel office chair is positioned directly in front of the desk, facing the south wall. This placement ensures ergonomic functionality and easy access to the desk, with dimensions (0.663m x 0.683m x 0.986m) that fit comfortably within the workspace area. The chair's modern style complements the desk, maintaining the minimalist aesthetic.

The white wooden bookshelf is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.3m x 2.0m) allow it to fit seamlessly into the room without obstructing the desk or chair. This placement provides easy access to storage while maintaining visual balance and adhering to the minimalist style.

The desk lamp is placed on the left side of the desk, facing the south wall. Its compact size (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) ensures it does not obstruct the workspace, providing focused lighting that enhances functionality and integrates with the minimalist design.

The clock is mounted on the north wall above the desk, facing the south wall. Its small size (0.3m x 0.05m x 0.3m) ensures it does not interfere with the workspace, providing timekeeping functionality while complementing the room's aesthetic.

The floor mat is placed in the middle of the room, providing an open area for stretching exercises. Its dimensions (1.8m x 0.6m x 0.01m) ensure it does not interfere with other objects, maintaining an open and functional space that adheres to the minimalist theme.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose regarding the placement of the desk lamp and the plant on the desk. The desk lamp's width was too small to accommodate the plant beside it without causing spatial issues. To resolve this, the plant was removed, as it was deemed less critical to the user's preference for a minimalist study focused on functionality and organization. This adjustment ensures the workspace remains uncluttered and adheres to the user's minimalist vision.
