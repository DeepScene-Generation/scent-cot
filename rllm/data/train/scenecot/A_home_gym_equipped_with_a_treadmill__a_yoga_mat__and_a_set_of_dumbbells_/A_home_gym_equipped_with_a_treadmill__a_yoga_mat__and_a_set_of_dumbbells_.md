## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a 5.0m x 5.0m x 3.0m home gym designed to accommodate various exercise zones, including cardio, flexibility, and strength training. Essential equipment specified includes a treadmill, yoga mat, and a set of dumbbells. The user desires a modern aesthetic, with additional suggestions for a mirror for form checks, a gym bench for versatile workouts, and storage solutions for the dumbbells. A wall clock for timing workouts and a small speaker system for motivational music are also recommended to enhance the gym atmosphere.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into distinct zones to fulfill the user's requirements. The Cardio Zone is along the south wall, where the treadmill is placed to leverage natural light. The Flexibility Zone is centrally located, providing an open area for yoga and relaxation exercises. The Strength Training Zone is along the north wall, where the dumbbells and gym bench are positioned for easy access. Additional areas include the west wall for a mirror to aid in form checks and the south wall for a wall clock to time workouts.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Cardio Zone, a modern treadmill measuring 2.0m x 0.8m x 1.5m is recommended. The Flexibility Zone features a minimalist yoga mat sized 1.8m x 0.6m x 0.02m. The Strength Training Zone includes a modern set of dumbbells (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.3m) and a gym bench (1.2m x 0.4m x 0.5m) for versatile workouts. A modern mirror (2.0m x 0.05m x 1.8m) is suggested for the west wall, and a wall clock (0.3m x 0.05m x 0.3m) is proposed for the south wall. A small speaker system (0.4m x 0.2m x 0.2m) is recommended for the west wall to provide motivational music.

## 4. Scene Graph
The treadmill is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to create a functional cardio workout area. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.8m x 1.5m) allow it to fit comfortably, providing a clear view across the room for motivation during workouts. This placement maximizes floor space for other equipment and aligns with the user's preference for a modern gym setup.

The yoga mat is positioned in the middle of the room, ensuring no obstruction from the treadmill or walls. Its size (1.8m x 0.6m x 0.02m) allows ample space for movement, enhancing the functionality and aesthetic of the home gym. This central placement supports flexibility and relaxation exercises without spatial conflicts.

The dumbbell set is placed in the northeast corner of the room, facing the west wall. Its compact size (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.3m) ensures it does not disrupt the flow of the room, providing easy access during strength training exercises. This strategic placement keeps the central area clear for other activities.

The mirror is mounted on the west wall, facing east, allowing users to check their form during workouts. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.05m x 1.8m) enhance the room's perceived space and complement the modern decor. This placement ensures visibility from the treadmill and yoga mat, supporting the user's functional needs.

The gym bench is placed on the north wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.4m x 0.5m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing the treadmill or yoga mat. This placement supports versatile workouts and maintains a clear flow in the room.

The dumbbell rack is positioned on the north wall, facing the south wall. Its size (1.0m x 0.5m x 0.8m) allows it to store dumbbells efficiently without interfering with other equipment. This placement creates a cohesive strength training area, enhancing functionality.

The wall clock is mounted on the south wall, centered above the treadmill. Its small size (0.3m x 0.05m x 0.3m) ensures it does not obstruct any objects, providing visibility for timing workouts. This placement aligns with the user's preference for a functional gym setup.

The speaker system is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, ensuring it projects sound across the room. Its compact size (0.4m x 0.2m x 0.2m) allows it to fit next to the mirror without interference, enhancing the gym atmosphere with motivational music.

## 5. Global Check
Initially, conflicts arose with the placement of the gym bench and dumbbell rack. The gym bench could not be placed right of the dumbbell set without going out of bounds. Similarly, the dumbbell rack could not be placed behind the dumbbell set. To resolve these conflicts, the gym bench was repositioned to the north wall, and the dumbbell rack was moved to the north wall as well. These adjustments ensured all equipment fit within the room's dimensions without spatial conflicts, maintaining the room's functionality and aesthetic.
