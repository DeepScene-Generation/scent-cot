## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a workshop setup that includes a sturdy wooden workbench, metal tools, and a wall-mounted pegboard for organization. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters. The layout emphasizes walls and an open middle space, which are crucial for tool access and project assembly. The user prioritizes functionality and organization, with a preference for an industrial aesthetic that supports efficient workflow and ergonomic design.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The workshop is divided into four key areas: the tool organization area, the open workspace, the south window for natural lighting, and the workbench itself. The tool organization area is designed to keep tools accessible and organized, primarily through the use of a pegboard. The open workspace is intended for assembling projects, requiring clear space for movement and activity. The south window provides natural light, enhancing visibility without additional window treatments. The workbench serves as the central work surface, positioned for optimal access to tools and materials.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the tool organization area, a wall-mounted pegboard is recommended to hold various tools, including hammers, wrenches, and screwdrivers, ensuring diverse functionality. The open workspace benefits from a rolling work cart, which facilitates the easy transport of tools and materials. The workbench, a crucial element, is recommended to be made of wood and positioned at an ergonomic height to support the craftsman's tasks. An overhead LED light is suggested to provide adequate illumination across the workspace, enhancing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 4. Scene Graph
The workbench, a central feature of the workshop, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement maximizes space usage and maintains a clear workspace in the center of the room. The workbench's dimensions are 2.0 meters in length, 0.8 meters in width, and 0.9 meters in height, fitting well within the 5.0-meter wall. This positioning allows for future organization with tools and a pegboard on adjacent walls, aligning with the user's emphasis on a central work surface.

The pegboard is mounted on the north wall directly above the workbench, facing the south wall. With dimensions of 1.5 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.0 meter, it fits comfortably above the workbench, ensuring easy access to tools while working. This placement supports the workbench's purpose and maintains the room's balance and proportion.

The hammer, wrench, and screwdriver are placed on the workbench, ensuring they are readily accessible and organized. The hammer measures 0.3 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.05 meters, the wrench is 0.25 meters by 0.08 meters by 0.03 meters, and the screwdriver is 0.2 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.05 meters. Each tool is oriented parallel to the width of the workbench, ensuring they do not obstruct the workspace while remaining easy to grab and use.

The rolling cart, measuring 0.8 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.9 meters, is placed to the right of the workbench, facing the south wall. This placement ensures it does not obstruct the main workspace while remaining within reach, facilitating the transport of tools and materials.

The overhead light is centrally placed on the ceiling, facing downward to illuminate the entire room. With dimensions of 1.0 meter by 0.2 meters by 0.1 meters, it provides optimal light distribution, enhancing the functionality and aesthetic of the workshop.

## 5. Global Check
There are no conflicts in the current layout, as all objects are placed with consideration of spatial relationships and user preferences. The placement of each object adheres to design principles, ensuring a functional and aesthetically pleasing workshop environment.

For overhead_light_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with ceiling
        - calculation:
            - Rotation of overhead_light_1: 0.0°
            - Rotation of ceiling: 0.0°
            - Rotation difference: |0.0 - 0.0| = 0.0°
        - conclusion: Using length dimension for directional constraint
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'on' relation
        - calculation:
            - overhead_light_1 size: 1.0 (length)
            - Cluster size (on): max(0.0, 1.0) = 1.0
        - conclusion: Size constraint (z_pos): 1.0
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'ceiling' constraint
        - calculation:
            - overhead_light_1 size: length=1.0, width=0.2, height=0.1
            - Room size: 5.0x5.0x3.0
            - x_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 1.0/2 = 0.5
            - x_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 1.0/2 = 4.5
            - y_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 0.2/2 = 0.1
            - y_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 0.2/2 = 4.9
            - z_min = 3.0 - 0.0/2 - 0.1/2 = 2.95
            - z_max = 3.0 - 0.0/2 - 0.1/2 = 2.95
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.5, 4.5, 0.1, 4.9, 2.95, 2.95)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.5-4.5), y(0.1-4.9)
            - Final coordinates: x=3.6957047462612227, y=3.1137069880381008, z=2.95
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 3.6957047462612227, y: 3.1137069880381008, z: 2.95
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=3.6957047462612227, y=3.1137069880381008, z=2.95
