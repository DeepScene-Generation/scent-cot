## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a creative workshop designed to facilitate crafting activities. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a sturdy crafts table, a pegboard tool organizer, and open shelving for storage. The user emphasizes the need for ergonomic placement to allow free movement and efficient workspace utilization. Additional preferences include a ceiling light fixture for warm lighting, a workshop stool, a tool chest, and a small workbench to enhance functionality. The overall style leans towards industrial and modern aesthetics, with a focus on practicality and organization.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to optimize the workshop's utility. The central area is designated for the crafts table, serving as the primary workspace. The north wall is reserved for the pegboard tool organizer, ensuring tools are easily accessible. The east wall is allocated for open shelving, providing storage for materials and completed projects. The ceiling is utilized for a light fixture to ensure adequate illumination. The west wall accommodates the tool chest, while the middle of the room allows for flexible seating arrangements with a chair and a workshop stool. The workbench is positioned parallel to the crafts table, enhancing the workspace.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central workspace, an industrial-style crafts table measuring 2.0 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.9 meters is recommended. A matching industrial chair (0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.0 meter) complements the table. The pegboard tool organizer, with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.8 meters, is suggested for the north wall. A modern shelving unit (2.0 meters by 0.4 meters by 2.0 meters) is proposed for the east wall. The ceiling light fixture, measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters, provides necessary lighting. An industrial workshop stool (0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.6 meters) offers additional seating. The tool chest (1.0 meter by 0.5 meter by 0.8 meter) is recommended for the west wall, and a workbench (1.5 meters by 0.7 meters by 0.9 meters) complements the crafts table.

## 4. Scene Graph
The crafts table is central to the workshop, placed in the middle of the room to optimize accessibility and workspace efficiency. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.9m) allow for free movement around it, and it faces the north wall to align with ergonomic principles and potential natural light. The chair is positioned directly in front of the crafts table, facing the north wall, ensuring comfortable engagement with the table. Its industrial style and dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 1.0m) complement the table, maintaining a cohesive aesthetic.

The pegboard tool organizer is mounted on the south wall, facing the north wall, to keep tools within easy reach from the crafts table. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.05m x 1.8m) and modern style enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic. The shelving unit is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall, providing ample storage without obstructing movement. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.4m x 2.0m) ensure it fits comfortably against the wall, maintaining balance in the room's layout.

The ceiling light fixture is centrally placed on the ceiling, directly above the crafts table, to provide even lighting across the workspace. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m) and modern style complement the room's industrial aesthetic. The workshop stool is placed to the right of the crafts table, facing the west wall, offering flexible seating without overcrowding the space. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.6m) ensure it fits comfortably in the room.

The tool chest is positioned against the west wall, facing the east wall, providing convenient tool storage without obstructing access to other elements. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.5m x 0.8m) and industrial style align with the workshop's theme. Finally, the workbench is placed parallel to the crafts table, left of it, and facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.7m x 0.9m) allow it to complement the crafts table, creating a cohesive and functional workspace.

## 5. Global Check
There are no conflicts detected in the current layout. The placement of each object respects the room's dimensions and user preferences, ensuring a functional and aesthetically pleasing workshop environment. All objects are positioned to maximize utility and maintain an open, inviting space.
