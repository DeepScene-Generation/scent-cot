## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a cozy reading nook within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary elements requested include a fabric armchair, a wooden side table, and a modern floor lamp, all contributing to a comfortable and inviting space for reading. The user emphasizes a blend of modern and traditional styles, aiming for a harmonious and functional setup that does not exceed nine objects in total.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into specific substructures to accommodate the reading nook. The primary area is the Seating Area, where the armchair is the focal point. Adjacent to this is the Accessory Area, which includes the side table and floor lamp to enhance functionality and aesthetics. The Storage Area is designated for a bookcase, providing space for books without overcrowding the seating zone. Additionally, a Comfort Area is defined by a rug, adding warmth and cohesion to the nook.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a cozy fabric armchair in beige is recommended, measuring 1.0 meters by 0.8 meters by 1.0 meters. The Accessory Area includes a traditional wooden side table (0.627 meters by 0.621 meters by 0.836 meters) and a modern metal floor lamp (0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.8 meters) to provide lighting. The Storage Area features a classic wooden bookcase (0.859 meters by 0.224 meters by 1.979 meters) for book storage. A cozy wool rug (1.5 meters by 1.0 meters) is suggested for the Comfort Area, and a blue fabric cushion (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters) enhances the armchair's comfort. A modern ceramic decorative item (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.5 meters) is recommended for aesthetic appeal.

## 4. Scene Graph
The armchair is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, to create a cozy and functional reading nook. This placement ensures the armchair is easily accessible and does not obstruct the room's flow, aligning with the user's preference for comfort and accessibility. The armchair's dimensions (1.0m x 0.8m x 1.0m) fit well against the wall, providing a sense of enclosure and coziness.

The side table is positioned to the right of the armchair on the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement ensures easy access from the armchair, maintaining balance and accessibility. The side table's dimensions (0.627m x 0.621m x 0.836m) allow it to fit comfortably next to the armchair, providing a convenient surface for books or a cup of tea.

The floor lamp is placed to the left of the armchair against the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement provides effective lighting for reading while maintaining the cozy aesthetic. The lamp's height (1.8 meters) ensures it stands without obstruction, complementing the armchair and side table arrangement.

The bookcase is positioned against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures it is accessible from the armchair and does not overcrowd the east wall. The bookcase's dimensions (0.859m x 0.224m x 1.979m) fit well against the wall, providing storage without obstructing movement or use.

The rug is placed centrally in front of the armchair, oriented parallel to the east wall. This placement unifies the reading area, providing a comfortable surface underfoot. The rug's dimensions (1.5m x 1.0m) ensure it fits well without overlapping adjacent furniture excessively.

The cushion is placed directly on the armchair, enhancing seating comfort and maintaining the cozy aesthetic. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m) allow it to fit comfortably without overwhelming the armchair.

The decorative item is placed on the side table, which is right of the armchair on the east wall. This placement ensures the item is within the user's sight while seated, enhancing the reading nook's ambiance. The item's dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.5m) fit comfortably on the side table, complementing the modern style of the lamp and the traditional wood of the table.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the placement of two cushions on the armchair, as the armchair's area was too small to accommodate both. To resolve this, cushion_2 was removed, as it was deemed less essential for the user's preference and the room's functionality. This adjustment ensures the armchair remains comfortable and aligns with the user's vision for a cozy reading nook.
