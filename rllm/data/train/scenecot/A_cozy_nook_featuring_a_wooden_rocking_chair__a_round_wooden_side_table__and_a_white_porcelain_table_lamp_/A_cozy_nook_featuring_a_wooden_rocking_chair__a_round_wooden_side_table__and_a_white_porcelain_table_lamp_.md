## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a cozy nook within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters. The primary elements include a wooden rocking chair, a round wooden side table, and a white porcelain table lamp. The goal is to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing space for relaxation, emphasizing comfort, convenience, and sufficient lighting. Additional elements such as a small rug, a cushion, a bookshelf, and a decorative plant are considered to enhance the nook's overall functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Seating Area is centered around the rocking chair, providing a stable and ergonomic space for relaxation. The Side Table Area is designed to hold personal items and support the table lamp, ensuring convenience and accessibility. The Lighting Area focuses on the table lamp to provide adequate illumination. Additional substructures include a Rug Area to define the space, a Cushion Area for added comfort, a Bookshelf Area for storing reading materials, and a Plant Area to introduce a touch of nature.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a classic wooden rocking chair is recommended, offering stability and comfort. The Side Table Area features a round wooden side table, complementing the rocking chair and providing a surface for personal items. The Lighting Area includes a white porcelain table lamp to enhance the room's ambiance. A minimalist beige rug is suggested to define the space, while a cream-colored cushion adds comfort to the rocking chair. A classic wooden bookshelf is proposed for storing books, and a small decorative plant in a ceramic pot is recommended to bring vibrancy to the nook.

## 4. Scene Graph
The rocking chair, a central element of the cozy nook, is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement provides stability and aligns with the user's preference for a cozy, natural aesthetic. The chair's dimensions (0.9m x 0.7m x 1.0m) fit comfortably within the room, ensuring no spatial conflicts. The side table is positioned to the right of the rocking chair, adjacent to it, and also faces the west wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.6m) allow it to complement the chair without overwhelming the space, providing easy access for personal items.

The table lamp is placed on the side table, facing the west wall, ensuring it provides adequate lighting without occupying floor space. Its small size (0.253m x 0.23m x 0.435m) fits comfortably on the table, enhancing the nook's functionality and aesthetic appeal. The rug, measuring 1.5m by 1.0m, is placed under the rocking chair and side table, defining the cozy nook area. Its minimalist style and beige color complement the existing natural wood tones and white porcelain lamp.

A cream-colored cushion is placed on the rocking chair, enhancing comfort and aligning with the user's vision of a cozy nook. The cushion's dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.1m) ensure it fits well without disrupting the current layout. The bookshelf, measuring 0.6m x 0.3m x 1.2m, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This location provides functional storage and aesthetically balances the room without crowding the existing arrangement. Finally, the plant is placed on the side table, alongside the table lamp, adding a decorative touch without interfering with existing elements. Its small size (0.229m x 0.177m x 0.224m) ensures it fits comfortably, enhancing the nook's aesthetic appeal.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects fit within the room's dimensions and align with the user's preferences and design principles. The arrangement ensures functionality and aesthetic appeal, creating a cohesive and inviting cozy nook.
