## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a grand foyer characterized by a luxurious and elegant atmosphere. Key elements include a white marble floor, a large golden chandelier, and a black wooden console table. These elements are essential for creating the desired aesthetic. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes the need for an open space to facilitate easy movement and create a strong first impression. Additional objects such as a large mirror, decorative vase, rug, wall sconces, and a coat stand are suggested to complement the existing elements, enhancing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The foyer is divided into several substructures to align with the user's requirements. The Central Lighting Area is designated for the chandelier, serving as the focal point. The Flooring Area encompasses the entire room, providing a luxurious base with white marble. The South Wall Area is reserved for the console table, mirror, and decorative elements, creating a cohesive visual display. The Middle Area is kept open to maintain the room's flow and accommodate the rug. The North Wall Area is used for additional lighting with a sconce, while the West Wall Area is designated for the coat stand, ensuring functionality without obstructing the main visual elements.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Central Lighting Area, a luxurious golden chandelier with dimensions of 1.0 meter by 1.0 meter by 1.0 meter is recommended to serve as the focal point. The Flooring Area features elegant white marble flooring, covering the entire 5.0-meter by 5.0-meter space. In the South Wall Area, a contemporary black wooden console table (1.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.8 meters) is suggested, complemented by a classic silver mirror (1.2 meters by 0.1 meters by 2.0 meters) and a modern white ceramic vase (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.6 meters). A contemporary gray wool rug (2.5 meters by 2.5 meters) is recommended for the Middle Area. The North Wall Area includes an antique bronze sconce (0.3 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters) for additional lighting, while the West Wall Area features a minimalist black metal coat stand (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.8 meters) for functionality.

## 4. Scene Graph
The chandelier is placed centrally on the ceiling, serving as the room's focal point. Its dimensions (1.0m x 1.0m x 1.0m) are appropriate for the room's size, ensuring it does not overwhelm the space. This central placement ensures even light distribution and aligns with the user's preference for a grand aesthetic. The console table is positioned against the south wall, facing the north wall. Its placement ensures it is a focal point upon entering the foyer, complementing the chandelier overhead. The table's dimensions (1.5m x 0.4m x 0.8m) allow it to stand out against the white marble floor, enhancing the room's elegance. The white marble flooring covers the entire room, providing a luxurious base that complements the gold chandelier and black console table. The mirror is mounted on the south wall above the console table, reflecting the chandelier's light and enhancing the room's grandeur. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.1m x 2.0m) ensure it does not obstruct the console table. The vase is placed on the console table, centered to complement the existing decor without obstructing the mirror. Its small size (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) ensures it fits comfortably. The rug is placed in the middle of the room, beneath the chandelier, complementing the marble floor and maintaining the room's open space aesthetic. Its dimensions (2.5m x 2.5m) ensure it does not interfere with the console table or mirror. The sconce is mounted on the north wall, facing the south wall, providing additional lighting and maintaining a balanced, symmetrical aesthetic. Its small size (0.3m x 0.2m x 0.5m) ensures it does not overwhelm the space. The coat stand is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall, ensuring it is accessible and does not interfere with the room's main focal points. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.8m) allow it to remain functional without overpowering the decor.

## 5. Global Check
There are no conflicts identified in the layout, as all objects are placed with careful consideration of spatial relationships and user preferences. The chandelier, console table, mirror, vase, rug, sconces, and coat stand are all positioned to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal without overlapping or obstructing each other. The placement of each object adheres to design principles of balance, proportion, and symmetry, ensuring a cohesive and luxurious atmosphere in the grand foyer.

    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with rug_1
        - calculation:
            - Rotation of coat_stand_1: 0.0°
            - Rotation of rug_1: 0.0°
            - Rotation difference: |0.0 - 0.0| = 0.0°
        - conclusion: Using length dimension for directional constraint
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'on' relation
        - calculation:
            - rug_1 size: 2.5 (length)
            - Cluster size (on): 0.0 (non-directional)
        - conclusion: No directional constraint applied
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'west_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - coat_stand_1 size: length=0.5, width=0.5, height=1.8
            - Room size: 5.0x5.0x3.0
            - x_min = 0 + 1 * 0.0/2 + 1 * 0.5/2 = 0.25
            - x_max = 0 + 1 * 0.0/2 + 1 * 0.5/2 = 0.25
            - y_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 0.5/2 = 0.25
            - y_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 0.5/2 = 4.75
            - z_min = z_max = 1.8/2 = 0.9
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 4.75, 0.9, 0.9)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.25-0.25), y(0.25-4.75)
            - Final coordinates: x=0.25, y=4.2222, z=0.9
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.25, y: 4.2222, z: 0.9
    5. reason: Collision check with rug_1
        - calculation:
            - Overlap detection: 0.25 ≤ 0.25 ≤ 0.25 → No collision
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Final coordinates: x=0.25, y=4.2222, z=0.9
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.25, y: 4.2222, z: 0.9
