## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a serene yoga studio characterized by a minimalist aesthetic, featuring a wooden floor, a wall-mounted mirror, and a stack of blue exercise mats. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary functional requirements include a stable surface for yoga practice, pose reflection via the mirror, and organized storage for exercise mats. The user desires a warm and inviting ambiance, enhanced by natural light, and prefers a layout that maintains an uncluttered and serene atmosphere.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Floor Area is designated for the wooden floor, providing a stable base for yoga practice. The Mirror Area on the north wall is intended for the wall-mounted mirror, essential for pose reflection. The Mat Storage Area along the west wall is for organizing exercise mats, ensuring the space remains uncluttered. Additionally, the Middle Area of the room is reserved for placing exercise mats, facilitating yoga practice, while the Corner Area in the southeast is designated for aesthetic enhancements like a plant.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Floor Area, a minimalist wooden floor covering the entire room (5.0m x 5.0m) is recommended to provide a stable and slip-resistant surface. The Mirror Area features a minimalist glass mirror (0.741m x 0.028m x 1.76m) mounted on the north wall for pose reflection. In the Mat Storage Area, a stack of blue exercise mats (each 1.8m x 0.6m x 0.02m) is suggested for organized storage. The Middle Area accommodates these mats for yoga practice, while the Corner Area includes a plant in a ceramic pot (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) to enhance the room's ambiance.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden floor is a foundational element, covering the entire room (5.0m x 5.0m x 0.01m) to provide a stable surface for yoga. It is placed directly on the floor, aligning with the user's vision of a serene yoga studio. The mirror is mounted on the north wall, facing the south wall, to allow users to view their poses easily. Its dimensions (0.741m x 0.028m x 1.76m) ensure it fits comfortably without obstruction, enhancing the room's aesthetic by adding depth. The first exercise mat is centrally placed on the wooden floor, facing the north wall, to maintain orientation with the room's layout. Its dimensions (1.8m x 0.6m x 0.02m) ensure stability and ease of use. The second exercise mat is placed parallel to the first, maintaining balance and symmetry. The plant is positioned in the southeast corner, where the south wall meets the east wall, facing northwest. This placement enhances the room's aesthetic appeal while maintaining functionality and alignment with the user's vision.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited space in the middle of the room, which could not accommodate all objects, including the exercise mats and yoga blocks. To resolve this, the yoga blocks were removed, as they were deemed less critical to the user's preference for a serene yoga studio with a wooden floor, wall-mounted mirror, and exercise mats. This adjustment ensured the room maintained its intended functionality and aesthetic without overcrowding.
