## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern cafeteria that emphasizes dining and easy access to snacks and beverages. Key elements include a long dining table, stackable chairs, and a vending machine, all contributing to a modern aesthetic. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for these elements. The user desires a functional yet stylish environment, with additional objects like lighting fixtures, wall art, and a rug to enhance the modern look and improve visual clarity. The arrangement should facilitate open movement for ease of cleaning and maintenance, with a total object count not exceeding twelve to maintain a balance between functionality and aesthetics.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The scene is divided into several substructures based on the user's requirements. The Central Dining Area is the focal point, featuring the dining table and stackable chairs for flexible seating. The Vending Machine Area is designated for quick access to snacks and beverages, enhancing convenience. The Lighting Area focuses on providing balanced illumination throughout the room. The Decorative Area includes wall art and a rug to enhance the modern aesthetic, while the Open Movement Space ensures ease of cleaning and maintenance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Central Dining Area, a modern-style dining table measuring 3.0 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.75 meters is recommended, accompanied by four stackable chairs, each 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.85 meters, to provide flexible seating. The Vending Machine Area features a modern vending machine (0.8 meters by 0.7 meters by 1.8 meters) for snacks and beverages. The Lighting Area includes a modern ceiling light (1.0 meter by 1.0 meter by 0.2 meters) to ensure even illumination. The Decorative Area is enhanced with wall art (1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 1.0 meter) and a rug (2.5 meters by 1.5 meters by 0.01 meters) to add visual interest and comfort.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dining table, a central element of the modern cafeteria, is placed in the middle of the room, oriented along its length. This central placement allows for functional use and aesthetic balance, enabling the room to accommodate additional seating and elements such as chairs and a vending machine. The table's dimensions (3.0m x 1.0m x 0.75m) ensure it serves as the focal point for dining activities, accessible from all sides for easy seating arrangements.

Stackable chairs are positioned around the dining table to facilitate seating. Stackable_chair_1 is placed to the right of the dining table, facing the west wall, while stackable_chair_2 is to the left, facing the east wall. Stackable_chair_3 is positioned in front of the dining table, facing the south wall, and stackable_chair_4 is behind the table, facing the north wall. Each chair measures 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.85 meters, ensuring they fit comfortably around the table without causing spatial clutter. This arrangement maintains balance and symmetry, enhancing the room's usability and aesthetic appeal.

The vending machine is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.7m x 1.8m) and placement ensure it is easily accessible without obstructing the dining area. This positioning supports the modern cafeteria theme and adds vertical interest to the room, balancing the horizontal dining table.

The ceiling light is centrally placed on the ceiling, providing balanced illumination throughout the room. Its dimensions (1.0m x 1.0m x 0.2m) ensure it does not conflict with other objects, enhancing both functionality and aesthetics. The modern style of the ceiling light aligns with the overall theme of the cafeteria.

Wall art is mounted on the south wall, facing north, at approximately 1.5 meters above the floor to ensure visibility and aesthetic appeal. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.0m) allow it to enhance the room's decor without overwhelming the space. This placement complements the modern style and provides a visual focal point upon entering the room.

The rug is placed under the dining table, centered in the room to maintain balance and provide comfort to the dining area. Its dimensions (2.5m x 1.5m x 0.01m) fit comfortably beneath the dining table without interfering with the chair arrangements. This placement enhances the aesthetic appeal of the space and provides a cozy feeling while dining.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were positioned to ensure functionality and aesthetic appeal, adhering to the user's vision of a modern cafeteria. The arrangement maintains open movement space, facilitating ease of cleaning and maintenance while ensuring the room remains visually balanced and uncluttered.
