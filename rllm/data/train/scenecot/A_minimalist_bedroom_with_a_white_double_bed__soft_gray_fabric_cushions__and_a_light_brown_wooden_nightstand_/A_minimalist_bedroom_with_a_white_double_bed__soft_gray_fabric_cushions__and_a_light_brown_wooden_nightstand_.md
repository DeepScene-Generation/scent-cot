## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a minimalist bedroom that emphasizes functionality and aesthetic simplicity. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a white double bed, soft gray fabric cushions, and a light brown wooden nightstand. The user prefers a limited color palette of white, gray, and light brown tones to maintain visual harmony. Additional items such as a soft rug, a small table lamp, a wall-mounted shelf, and a floor mirror are considered to enhance functionality without overwhelming the minimalist design.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main areas: the Double Bed Area, the Nightstand Area, and the Open Movement Space. The Double Bed Area serves as the focal point of the room, emphasizing the minimalist aesthetic. The Nightstand Area provides necessary storage and complements the bed's functionality. The Open Movement Space ensures ease of movement and maintains the room's uncluttered appearance, with potential for additional elements like a rug or mirror to enhance comfort and depth.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Double Bed Area, a minimalist white double bed measuring 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters is recommended. Soft gray fabric cushions, each 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.15 meters, are suggested to add comfort. A light brown wooden nightstand measuring 0.52 meters by 0.38 meters by 0.62 meters is proposed for the Nightstand Area. A minimalist white metal lamp (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.4 meters) is recommended for the nightstand. A white wooden shelf (1.0 meters by 0.25 meters by 0.2 meters) and a large glass mirror (1.5 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.76 meters) are suggested for additional storage and reflection, respectively.

## 4. Scene Graph
The white double bed is placed centrally against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement maximizes space efficiency and adheres to the minimalist aesthetic by maintaining symmetry and providing sufficient space for additional items like the nightstand and cushions. The bed's dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.5m) ensure it is the focal point of the room, aligning with the user's vision.

Cushion_1 and Cushion_2 are placed on the bed, centrally aligned and adjacent to each other, facing the north wall. Their dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.15m each) allow them to fit comfortably on the bed without overcrowding, adding comfort and maintaining the minimalist style.

The light brown wooden nightstand is placed to the left of the bed on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.52m x 0.38m x 0.62m) fit well beside the bed, providing easy access and maintaining balance. The nightstand complements the bed's functionality and aesthetic.

The minimalist white metal lamp is placed on the nightstand, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.4m) fit comfortably on the nightstand's surface, providing convenient lighting for the bed area while maintaining a clean and uncluttered look.

The white wooden shelf is mounted on the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.25m x 0.2m) allow it to fit comfortably without overwhelming the space, providing accessible storage that complements the existing furniture and maintains the room's aesthetic.

The large glass mirror is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.05m x 1.76m) ensure it does not obstruct movement or clash with other objects. This placement enhances the room's functionality by reflecting light and creating an illusion of more space, aligning with the minimalist aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the south wall being too small to accommodate the bed, nightstand, and rug simultaneously. To resolve this, the rug was removed, as it was deemed the least important for the user's preference and the room's functionality. This decision maintains the minimalist aesthetic and ensures the room remains uncluttered and functional.
