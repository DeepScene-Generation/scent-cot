## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a professional home studio that emphasizes functionality for workspace, video production, and virtual meetings. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key requirements include a modern desk and ergonomic chair for the workspace, a green screen setup for video production, a clutter-free virtual meeting area, and open movement space. The user also emphasizes the need for up to 15 essential objects that optimize both functionality and aesthetic appeal, ensuring the studio remains organized and efficient.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures based on the user's requirements. The Desk and Chair Area is designated for the workspace, featuring a modern desk and ergonomic chair. The Green Screen Setup is essential for video production, requiring a clear backdrop. The Virtual Meeting Area is designed to be clutter-free and well-lit, ensuring optimal conditions for virtual interactions. Additionally, an Open Movement Space is maintained to ensure the room remains organized and accessible, with a storage cabinet to store equipment and supplies.
