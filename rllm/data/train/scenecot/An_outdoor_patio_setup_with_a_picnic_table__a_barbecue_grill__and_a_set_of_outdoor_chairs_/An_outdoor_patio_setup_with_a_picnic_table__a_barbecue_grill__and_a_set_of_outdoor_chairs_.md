## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions an outdoor patio that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing, featuring essential items such as a picnic table, barbecue grill, and outdoor chairs. The patio should facilitate dining, social interaction, and outdoor cooking, with a layout that ensures easy movement and accessibility. The user prefers a rustic style for the main furniture pieces, complemented by modern elements for seating and lighting. The patio should accommodate 8 to 10 items, including additional elements like outdoor lighting, a side table, and a plant pot to enhance ambiance and functionality.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The patio is divided into several functional substructures: the Dining Area, centered around the picnic table for meals and gatherings; the Seating Area, with weather-resistant chairs for guest comfort; the Barbecue Area, positioned against the south wall for optimal smoke dispersal and accessibility; and the Movement Space, ensuring seamless flow between areas. Additional elements like outdoor lighting and decorative items are strategically placed to enhance the overall ambiance and functionality.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Dining Area, a robust wooden picnic table is recommended as the focal point, with dimensions of 2.0m x 1.0m x 0.75m. The Seating Area includes a set of four modern metal chairs, each measuring 0.6m x 0.6m x 0.9m, designed for comfort and style. The Barbecue Area features a contemporary stainless steel grill, 1.2m x 0.6m x 1.0m, for outdoor cooking. Additional recommendations include a modern outdoor light (0.2m x 0.2m x 1.5m) for illumination and a rustic side table (0.6m x 0.6m) for added functionality.

## 4. Scene Graph
The picnic table is centrally placed in the room, facing the north wall, serving as the focal point for dining activities. Its rustic style and wooden material enhance the outdoor aesthetic, and its central location allows easy access from all sides, aligning with the user's vision of an inviting outdoor setup. The four outdoor chairs are strategically positioned around the picnic table: one in front facing the south wall, one to the right facing the west wall, one to the left facing the east wall, and one behind facing the north wall. This arrangement ensures balance, symmetry, and functionality for social interaction and dining.

The barbecue grill is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, ensuring it is accessible for cooking while maintaining safety and ventilation. This placement allows for easy serving to the dining area without obstructing movement. The outdoor light is installed on the east wall, facing the west wall, providing balanced illumination across the patio setup without interfering with the functionality or movement. The side table, initially placed to the right of the picnic table, was intended to serve as a functional extension for holding items during dining but was removed due to spatial conflicts.

## 5. Global Check
Two conflicts were identified during the placement process. The first involved the outdoor light and plant pot, where the light's width was insufficient to accommodate the plant pot to its left. The plant pot was removed as it was deemed less critical to the user's preference for a functional patio setup. The second conflict involved the picnic table, outdoor chair, and side table, where the table's width could not accommodate both the chair and side table to its right. The side table was removed, prioritizing the seating arrangement essential for the user's desired outdoor dining experience.
