## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a dining area that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing, with a focus on elegance. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a large wooden dining table, upholstered dining chairs, and an elegant chandelier. The dining table should accommodate eight people comfortably, and the chairs should offer both comfort and style. The chandelier is intended to be a focal point, providing illumination and sophistication. The user also expressed interest in potentially adding a sideboard or buffet for storage, complementing the dining setup.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into a central Dining Area, which is the primary focus, featuring the dining table and chairs. This area is designed to facilitate gatherings and ensure ample space for movement and seating. The Lighting Area is centered above the dining table, where the chandelier is placed to provide balanced illumination. The potential Storage Area is considered for additional items like a sideboard, enhancing functionality and complementing the dining setup.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Dining Area, an elegant wooden dining table measuring 2.5 meters by 1.2 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended. Eight upholstered dining chairs, each measuring 0.368 meters by 0.404 meters by 0.837 meters, are suggested to surround the table, offering comfort and style. The chandelier, made of crystal and metal, with dimensions of 0.828 meters by 0.828 meters by 1.019 meters, is recommended for the Lighting Area to enhance the room's elegance and provide adequate lighting.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dining table is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall. This central placement allows for even distribution of chairs around it, making it the focal point of the dining area. The table's dimensions (2.5m x 1.2m x 0.75m) ensure it fits comfortably within the room, providing access from all sides and aligning with the user's preference for an elegant centerpiece.

Dining Chair 1 is placed to the left of the dining table, facing the east wall. This placement complements the table and maintains the room's aesthetic, ensuring functional seating without obstructing pathways. Dining Chair 2 is positioned to the right of the table, facing the west wall, creating symmetry with Dining Chair 1 and maintaining a balanced setup. Dining Chair 3 is placed in front of the table, facing the south wall, ensuring symmetry and balance in the arrangement. Dining Chair 4 is positioned behind the table, facing the north wall, completing the symmetrical setup around the table.

Dining Chair 5 is placed in front of and slightly to the right of the table, facing the north wall. This placement maintains symmetry and enhances the room's elegance. Dining Chair 6 is positioned behind the table, adjacent to Dining Chair 4, facing the north wall, ensuring balanced seating. Dining Chair 7 is placed to the left of Dining Chair 3, facing the south wall, maintaining harmony with the overall setup. Dining Chair 8 is placed behind the table, adjacent to Dining Chair 6, facing the north wall, ensuring uniformity and accessibility.

The chandelier is centered above the dining table, hanging from the ceiling. This placement ensures even lighting for all seated guests and complements the elegant style of the dining area, adhering to design principles of balance and proportion.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with Dining Chair 8, initially placed left of Dining Chair 6, where Dining Chair 4 was already positioned. To resolve this, Dining Chair 8 was repositioned to the right of Dining Chair 6, maintaining adjacency to the dining table and ensuring no spatial conflicts. This adjustment preserved the room's symmetry and functionality, aligning with the user's preferences for an elegant and balanced dining area.
