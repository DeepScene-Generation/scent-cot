## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a contemporary bedroom setup that emphasizes a minimalist and uncluttered aesthetic, with a warm atmosphere and functionality for resting, reading, and storage. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user specifically requests a double bed, a nightstand, and a low chest for storage, all of which should align with the contemporary style. Additional elements such as a rug, wall art, and a plant are considered to enhance the room's warmth, texture, and natural appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional areas based on the user's requirements. The 'Double Bed Area' is designated for rest and sleep, serving as the focal point of the room. The 'Nightstand Area' is adjacent to the bed, providing space for essential items and a lamp for nighttime reading. The 'Low Chest Storage Area' is intended for storing blankets and linens, ensuring easy access and movement. Additional areas include a space for a rug to add warmth and texture, a wall for artwork to enhance aesthetic appeal, and a corner for a plant to introduce a natural element.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the 'Double Bed Area,' a modern-style double bed made of wood, measuring 2.0 meters by 1.8 meters by 0.5 meters, is recommended to provide stability and comfort. The 'Nightstand Area' features a sleek, modern nightstand with dimensions of 0.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.6 meters, complemented by a small lamp measuring 0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters. The 'Low Chest Storage Area' includes a modern low chest made of wood, measuring 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters. A contemporary rug (2.0 meters by 1.5 meters) is suggested to add warmth and texture, while abstract wall art (1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 0.7 meters) and a modern plant in a ceramic pot (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.0 meter) enhance the room's aesthetic and natural appeal.

## 4. Scene Graph
The double bed is the primary focal point in the bedroom, placed against the south wall to maximize space and allow easy access around it. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.8m x 0.5m) fit well against the wall, facing the north wall, ensuring balance and proportion within the room. This placement leaves sufficient space on either side for additional furniture like nightstands or a low chest, aligning with the user's contemporary setup preference.

The nightstand is placed to the left of the double bed on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.4m x 0.6m) allow it to fit comfortably beside the bed, providing easy access to items while in bed. This placement maintains balance and proportion in the room, adhering to modern design principles and ensuring the nightstand's functionality as a holder for items.

The lamp is positioned on the nightstand, facing the north wall. Its small size (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) fits comfortably on the nightstand's top area, providing lighting for nighttime reading. This placement ensures the lamp is adjacent to the bed, enhancing usability and aesthetics while maintaining the room's contemporary style.

The low chest is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.5m x 0.5m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall without obstructing movement or the functionality of other objects. This placement ensures easy access for storage, aligning with the contemporary aesthetic and maintaining room functionality.

The rug is placed in the middle of the room, partially under the double bed and extending outwards. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m) ensure it does not interfere with the nightstand or low chest, maintaining balance and proportion in the room. This placement adds warmth and texture, aligning with the contemporary style and enhancing the room's aesthetic.

The wall art is placed on the south wall, centered above the double bed. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.7m) fit well above the bed, enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the space and creating a cohesive visual centerpiece. This placement adheres to design principles of balance and proportion, adding to the room's contemporary look.

The plant is placed on the east wall, to the right of the low chest, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably within available spaces without overwhelming the room. This placement maintains the room's aesthetic balance and complements the existing contemporary decor, adding a calming, natural element.

## 5. Global Check
There are no conflicts in the room layout, as all objects are placed without overlapping or causing spatial issues. The placement of each object aligns with the user's preferences and design principles, ensuring a cohesive and functional contemporary bedroom setup.
