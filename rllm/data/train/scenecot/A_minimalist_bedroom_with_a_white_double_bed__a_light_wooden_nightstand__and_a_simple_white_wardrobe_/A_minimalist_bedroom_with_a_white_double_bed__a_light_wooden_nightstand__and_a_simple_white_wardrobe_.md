## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a minimalist bedroom characterized by a neutral color palette and a serene atmosphere. Key elements include a white double bed, a light wooden nightstand, and a simple white wardrobe. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, is designed to provide restful sleep, storage for clothing and personal items, and lighting for nighttime reading. Additional elements such as a small lamp, a rug, an art piece, a chair, a plant, and a clock are suggested to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetics while maintaining a minimalist aesthetic.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Bed Area is positioned against the north wall, serving as the focal point for restful sleep. The Storage Area is located on the east wall, accommodating the wardrobe for clothing storage. The Nightstand Area, adjacent to the bed, provides a surface for a lamp and personal items. The Middle Area features a rug for added comfort and warmth. The Aesthetic Area includes an art piece above the bed and a clock for timekeeping. The Seating Area, with a chair, is positioned for reading and relaxation. Lastly, the Decorative Area, with a plant, adds a touch of nature to the room.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Bed Area, a minimalist white double bed measuring 2.0 meters by 1.8 meters by 0.5 meters is recommended. The Nightstand Area features a light wooden nightstand (0.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.5 meters) to hold items like a lamp. The Storage Area includes a simple white wardrobe (1.5 meters by 0.6 meters by 2.0 meters) for clothing. A modern metal lamp (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters) is suggested for the nightstand. The Middle Area features a beige cotton rug (1.6 meters by 2.3 meters) for comfort. An abstract art piece (1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 0.7 meters) and a modern black clock (0.3 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.3 meters) enhance the Aesthetic Area. A minimalist metal chair (0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.0 meter) provides seating, while a green plant in a ceramic pot (0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.8 meters) adds decoration.

## 4. Scene Graph
The bed, a central element in the minimalist bedroom, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement maximizes space and provides a focal point, allowing easy access from both sides. The bed's dimensions (2.0m x 1.8m x 0.5m) fit comfortably, leaving ample space for other furniture. The nightstand, measuring 0.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.5 meters, is placed to the right of the bed on the north wall, ensuring functional accessibility and maintaining a minimalist aesthetic. The wardrobe, with dimensions of 1.5 meters by 0.6 meters by 2.0 meters, is positioned on the east wall, facing the west wall, avoiding conflicts with the bed and nightstand while providing easy access to storage.

The lamp, a modern metal piece measuring 0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters, is placed on the nightstand, facing the south wall. This placement ensures functionality and aligns with the minimalist style by reducing clutter. The rug, measuring 1.6 meters by 2.3 meters, is placed in the middle of the room, adding comfort and texture without overwhelming the space. The art piece, an abstract canvas (1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 0.7 meters), is hung on the north wall above the bed, serving as a focal point and complementing the minimalist design. The chair, measuring 0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.0 meter, is placed to the left of the bed along the north wall, providing additional seating without disrupting the room's balance.

The plant, in a ceramic pot measuring 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.8 meters, is placed on the east wall, right of the wardrobe, enhancing the room's aesthetic without obstructing movement. Finally, the clock, a modern black piece measuring 0.3 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.3 meters, is placed on the north wall, adjacent to the art piece, ensuring visibility for timekeeping and enhancing the minimalist design.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed in a manner that respects the room's minimalist aesthetic and functional requirements, ensuring a harmonious and clutter-free environment.
