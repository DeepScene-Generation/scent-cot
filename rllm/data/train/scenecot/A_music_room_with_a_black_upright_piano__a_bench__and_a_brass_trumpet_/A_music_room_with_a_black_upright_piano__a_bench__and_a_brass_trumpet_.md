## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a music room that includes an upright piano, a bench, and a brass trumpet, emphasizing a harmonious and inviting ambiance. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary focus is on creating a functional space for music practice and enjoyment, with a modern aesthetic. Key elements include a piano area, a trumpet stand area, acoustic enhancements, and a central open space defined by a rug. The user prioritizes essential items that enhance the room's musical purpose while maintaining a balance between functionality and aesthetics.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Piano Area is designated for the upright piano and bench, ensuring comfort and optimal sound projection. The Trumpet Stand Area provides a dedicated space for the brass trumpet, maintaining an organized layout. The Acoustic Enhancement Area focuses on improving sound quality with acoustic panels strategically placed to enhance acoustics without cluttering the space. Lastly, the Central Open Space is defined by a rug, creating a cozy and inviting area for music activities while ensuring the room remains open and unobstructed.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Piano Area, a modern black upright piano and an ergonomic bench are recommended to provide comfort and enhance sound projection. The Trumpet Stand Area features a classic brass trumpet stand, complementing the room's musical theme. In the Acoustic Enhancement Area, elegant fabric acoustic panels are suggested to improve sound quality. The Central Open Space is defined by a minimalist beige wool rug, which enhances acoustics and adds warmth to the room. Additional recommendations include a music stand for sheet music and a comfortable chair for listening or resting, although these were deprioritized due to spatial constraints.

## 4. Scene Graph
The upright piano, a focal point of the music room, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement maximizes space and ensures stability, enhancing sound projection by utilizing the wall's reflective properties. The piano's dimensions (1.5m x 0.6m x 1.2m) fit comfortably against the wall, creating a strong visual impact and maintaining balance within the room.

The bench is positioned directly in front of the piano, facing the south wall, to provide seating for playing music. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.4m x 0.5m) allow it to fit seamlessly in front of the piano without obstructing other elements, ensuring functionality and aesthetic alignment with the music room theme.

The trumpet stand is placed on the south wall, to the left of the bench, facing the north wall. This location ensures accessibility and does not block the room's flow. The stand's dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.7m) allow it to fit neatly beside the bench, maintaining a clear and organized layout.

Acoustic panels are strategically placed to enhance sound quality. The first panel is mounted on the north wall, facing the south wall, while the second panel is symmetrically placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. Each panel measures 1.0m x 0.05m x 1.0m, fitting easily on the walls without occupying floor space, thus enhancing acoustics and maintaining visual symmetry.

The rug is centrally placed in the room, defining the open space and adding warmth. Its dimensions (3.0m x 2.0m) allow it to fit comfortably in the middle of the room, avoiding conflicts with existing objects along the walls. The rug's minimalist style and beige color complement the modern black piano and bench, creating a balanced and inviting music area.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to spatial constraints. The trumpet stand's width was insufficient to accommodate the music stand to its right, and the bench's width could not accommodate the chair to its right. To resolve these conflicts, the music stand and chair were removed, as they were deemed less critical to the room's primary function of music practice. This decision ensured that the essential elements—the piano, bench, trumpet stand, acoustic panels, and rug—remained, preserving the room's functionality and aesthetic integrity.
