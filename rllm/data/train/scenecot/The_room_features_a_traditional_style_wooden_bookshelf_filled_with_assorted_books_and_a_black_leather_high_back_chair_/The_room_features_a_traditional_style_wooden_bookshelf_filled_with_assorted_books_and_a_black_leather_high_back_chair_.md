## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a traditional-style room designed as a reading nook, emphasizing a mahogany wooden bookshelf and a black leather high-back chair. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters. The user's preferences include creating a cozy and functional space for reading, with ambient lighting and additional elements like a side table and a floor lamp to enhance the traditional ambiance. The room should also incorporate a soft area rug for comfort and a decorative piece, such as a clock, to add character.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The primary substructure is the Reading Nook, which includes the leather chair, side table, and floor lamp, designed for comfort and functionality. The Bookshelf Area is designated for the mahogany bookshelf, providing storage and organization for books. Ambient Lighting is another substructure, ensuring adequate illumination for reading. Additionally, a Decorative Area is identified for elements like a clock to enhance the room's traditional aesthetic.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Reading Nook, a black leather high-back chair is recommended for comfortable seating, accompanied by a traditional wooden side table and a metal floor lamp for lighting. The Bookshelf Area features a substantial mahogany wooden bookshelf, complemented by wooden bookends for organization. A traditional woolen rug is suggested for comfort underfoot, and a decorative gold clock is proposed to add visual interest and character to the room.

## 4. Scene Graph
The leather chair, a central element of the reading nook, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions are 0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 1.2 meters. This placement provides a stable backdrop and allows for a clear view into the room, aligning with its function as a comfortable seating option. The chair's position anticipates future additions, such as the bookshelf, to create a cohesive reading area.

The wooden bookshelf, measuring 1.5 meters by 0.3 meters by 2.0 meters, is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. This location ensures stability and accessibility, complementing the leather chair's traditional style. The bookshelf's placement maintains balance and proportion, allowing the chair to be easily moved to face it when desired.

The floor lamp, with dimensions of 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.5 meters, is positioned to the right of the leather chair, facing the north wall. This placement provides optimal lighting for reading without obstructing movement, adhering to the traditional style and enhancing the reading nook's functionality.

The side table, measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.6 meters, is placed to the left of the leather chair, facing the north wall. This arrangement ensures easy access from the chair and maintains the room's traditional style and functionality, providing a practical surface for holding items.

The rug, with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters, is centered in front of the leather chair, enhancing the reading nook's comfort and aesthetic. Its placement does not obstruct other objects and aligns with the user's preference for a traditional style.

Bookend 1 and Bookend 2, each measuring 0.2 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.3 meters, are placed on the wooden bookshelf, facing the west wall. These bookends enhance the bookshelf's functionality and aesthetic, maintaining symmetry and organization.

The decorative clock, measuring 0.3 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.3 meters, is placed on the side table, facing the north wall. This placement adds a cohesive decorative element to the reading nook, complementing the traditional style and enhancing the room's aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed considering spatial constraints and user preferences, ensuring a harmonious and functional traditional-style reading nook.
