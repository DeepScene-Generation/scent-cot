## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a zen garden room that emphasizes tranquility and natural elements, with a focus on creating a serene ambiance. The room is 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a low wooden table, floor cushions, and a bamboo plant, all contributing to a peaceful atmosphere. The user desires a layout that maintains functionality while enhancing the zen theme, suggesting the inclusion of minimalistic art and a small water feature to complement the natural elements without cluttering the space.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to align with the user's zen garden vision. The central seating area is designated for the low wooden table and floor cushions, facilitating meditation and relaxation. A dedicated corner is reserved for the bamboo plant, reinforcing the connection with nature. The walls serve as potential locations for minimalistic art and a water feature, enhancing the zen theme without overwhelming the space. The open reflection space remains uncluttered, allowing for movement and introspection.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central seating area, a zen-style low wooden table (1.2m x 0.8m x 0.4m) is recommended, surrounded by four soft beige fabric cushions (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.15m each) for meditation. A bamboo plant (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.8m) is suggested for the corner to enhance the natural ambiance. A minimalist art piece (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.7m) is proposed for the south wall, providing visual simplicity. A zen-style stone water feature (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.5m) is recommended for the north wall to enhance the room's tranquility.

## 4. Scene Graph
The low wooden table is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall, to serve as a focal point and maintain balance. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.8m x 0.4m) fit well within the central space, allowing ample room for movement and additional objects. This placement aligns with the user's preference for a zen garden setting, centralizing the table for tea or reading activities and adhering to design principles of balance and proportion.

Cushion_1 is placed to the right of the table, facing the north wall, with its edge aligned parallel to the table. This placement respects the user's vision for a zen garden room, ensuring both functionality and aesthetic appeal. Cushion_2 is symmetrically placed to the left of the table, maintaining balance and providing seating for meditation. Cushion_3 is positioned in front of the table, creating an even distribution of seating and maintaining the zen aesthetic. Cushion_4 is placed behind the table, forming a balanced seating area with the other cushions.

The bamboo plant is placed in the corner of the east and south walls, on the floor, facing the west wall. This placement ensures no spatial conflicts, complements the zen style of the room, and adds to the functionality and aesthetic appeal by providing a natural focal point. The art piece is mounted on the south wall, facing the north wall, maintaining balance and harmony within the space while enhancing the room's zen aesthetic. The water feature is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall, ensuring visibility from the main seating area and complementing the existing zen elements without causing spatial conflicts.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the initial placement of the art piece, which was positioned left of the bamboo plant, leading to an out-of-bounds issue. To resolve this, the art piece was repositioned exclusively on the south wall, ensuring it does not overlap with the bamboo plant or extend beyond the room's boundaries. This adjustment maintains the room's aesthetic balance and adheres to the user's vision for a peaceful zen garden room.
