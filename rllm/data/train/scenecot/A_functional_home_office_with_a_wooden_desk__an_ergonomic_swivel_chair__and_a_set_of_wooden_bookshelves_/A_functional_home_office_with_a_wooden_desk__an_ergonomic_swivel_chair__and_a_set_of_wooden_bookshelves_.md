## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a functional home office that includes a wooden desk, an ergonomic swivel chair, and a set of wooden bookshelves. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes the need for a workspace that is both productive and aesthetically pleasing, with a focus on essential furniture and accessories that enhance functionality. The user prefers a clutter-free environment, avoiding items related to windows or doors, and aims to keep the total number of objects within the room to a maximum of 15.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key areas to meet the user's requirements. The 'Desk Area' is designated for the wooden desk and ergonomic swivel chair, providing a primary workspace. The 'Bookshelf Area' is intended for wooden bookshelves, offering storage and organization. The 'Open Middle Space' is kept free of clutter to allow easy movement and relaxation, potentially featuring a small rug and seating for comfort. The 'Clutter-free Workspace' focuses on organization tools like a desk organizer and filing cabinet to maintain a tidy environment.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the 'Desk Area,' a modern wooden desk and an ergonomic swivel chair are recommended to support long hours of work. A task lamp is suggested to provide adequate lighting. The 'Bookshelf Area' features sturdy wooden bookshelves that harmonize with the desk's wood tone, complemented by decorative bookends. In the 'Open Middle Space,' a minimalist wool rug and a modern armchair are proposed to add comfort and style. The 'Clutter-free Workspace' includes a modern plastic desk organizer and a metal filing cabinet to enhance organization and storage.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden desk is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to create a functional home office setup. Its dimensions are 1.6 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.75 meters. This placement ensures ample space in the middle of the room for movement and aligns with the user's requirement for a productive workspace. The ergonomic swivel chair is positioned directly in front of the desk, facing the south wall, with dimensions of 0.686 meters by 0.681 meters by 1.043 meters. This arrangement supports its use with the desk, maintaining a natural office setup.

The task lamp, measuring 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.5 meters, is placed on the desk to the left of the workspace, providing optimal lighting without interfering with the chair's movement. The wooden bookshelves, with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.3 meters by 2.0 meters, are placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This location offers easy access from the desk and maintains an open space in the middle of the room. The artistic bronze bookends are placed on the bookshelves, enhancing the organization of books.

The minimalist wool rug, measuring 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters, is centrally placed in the room, providing comfort and style without obstructing the functional areas. The modern armchair, with dimensions of 0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 1.0 meters, is positioned in the north-west corner against the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement allows for relaxation while maintaining a balanced distribution of furniture. The modern plastic desk organizer, measuring 0.4 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.3 meters, is placed on the desk to the right of the task lamp, ensuring an organized work environment. The metal filing cabinet, with dimensions of 0.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.7 meters, is placed against the west wall, right of the armchair, providing accessible storage without obstructing movement.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the armchair's initial placement, as it was positioned in a corner with only one wall relationship. To resolve this, the armchair was repositioned to the north-west corner, against both the west and north walls, ensuring it fits within the room's layout without obstructing pathways or work areas. This adjustment maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic balance, aligning with the user's vision of a functional home office.
