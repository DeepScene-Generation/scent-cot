## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a personal gym within a 5.0m x 5.0m x 3.0m room, designed to accommodate strength training, yoga, and core exercises. The primary equipment includes a set of rubber dumbbells, a yoga mat, and an exercise ball. The user emphasizes a clutter-free, energizing, and harmonious environment, with a focus on organization, safety, and usability. The gym should be functional and aesthetically pleasing, with a modern style that supports various workout activities.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to optimize functionality and aesthetics. The Dumbbell Rack Area is designated for organizing dumbbells, ensuring safety and easy access. The Yoga Mat Area is centrally located for yoga and stretching exercises. The Exercise Ball Area is positioned to support core and balance exercises. An Open Transition Space is maintained for movement between activities, and a Storage Area is included for additional equipment storage. Each substructure is designed to enhance the gym's usability and maintain a clean, organized appearance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Dumbbell Rack Area, a modern metal dumbbell rack (1.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) is recommended to organize the rubber dumbbells. The Yoga Mat Area features a minimalist rubber yoga mat (1.8m x 0.6m x 0.02m) for stretching exercises. In the Exercise Ball Area, a modern rubber exercise ball (0.65m diameter) is suggested for core exercises. A modern glass floor mirror (1.0m x 0.1m x 2.0m) is recommended for visual feedback during workouts. A modern wooden wall shelf (1.0m x 0.3m x 0.2m) is proposed for storing yoga accessories, and a modern wooden storage bench (1.0m x 0.4m x 0.5m) is included for additional equipment storage.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dumbbell rack is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall, to organize the rubber dumbbells and maintain an open floor space for exercises. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) ensure stability and accessibility, aligning with the user's preference for a tidy gym. Dumbbell_1, a modern rubber dumbbell (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.3m), is placed on the dumbbell rack, ensuring safety and organization. The yoga mat is centrally located in the room, facing the north wall, providing ample space for movement and stretching. Its placement ensures accessibility from all sides, adhering to design principles of balance and proportion. The exercise ball is positioned against the east wall, facing the west wall, to minimize interference with the yoga mat and maintain balance within the room. The floor mirror is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, to provide visual feedback during exercises. Its tall height (2.0m) ensures it stands securely and enhances the gym's functionality. The wall shelf is mounted on the north wall, above the yoga mat area, to store yoga accessories conveniently. Its placement maintains an organized and accessible layout. The storage bench is placed on the east wall, adjacent to the exercise ball, facing the west wall. This placement ensures functionality and aesthetic appeal without interfering with existing objects in the gym.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts were identified. The yoga mat's length was insufficient to accommodate the rubber flooring mat in front of it, leading to the decision to delete the rubber flooring mat due to its lower priority compared to the yoga mat. Additionally, the dumbbell rack's area was too small to accommodate both dumbbell_1 and dumbbell_2, resulting in the removal of dumbbell_2 to maintain the room's functionality and user preference for a set of rubber dumbbells. These adjustments ensure the gym remains functional, organized, and aligned with the user's vision.
