## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a room characterized by minimal furniture and decor, emphasizing relaxation and aesthetics. Key elements include a patterned rug, a classic wooden rocking chair, and a ceramic vase with flowers. The room is intended to be simple yet elegant, with a focus on creating a relaxing atmosphere. The dimensions of the room are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for the desired elements. The user prefers a classic style with natural elements to enhance the ambiance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main areas based on the user's requirements. The Relaxation Area is designated for the rocking chair, providing a space for comfort and leisure. The Decorative Center Area features the patterned rug and a side table with a vase, forming the room's focal point. Lastly, the Natural Element Space is enhanced by the vase with fresh flowers, contributing to the room's ambiance and aesthetic appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Relaxation Area, a classic wooden rocking chair with dimensions of 0.8 meters by 1.0 meters by 1.2 meters is recommended, complemented by a cushion for added comfort. The Decorative Center Area includes a black and white patterned rug (2.0 meters by 2.0 meters) and a classic wooden side table (0.627 meters by 0.621 meters by 0.836 meters) to hold a white ceramic vase (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters) with fresh flowers. The Natural Element Space is further enhanced by a classic metal plant stand (0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.7 meters) and a classic wooden shelf (1.0 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.8 meters) for additional storage and display.

## 4. Scene Graph
The rocking chair is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to provide stability and support while allowing for a pleasant view and easy access. Its dimensions (0.8m x 1.0m x 1.2m) ensure it fits comfortably in the room, serving as a focal point for relaxation. The placement aligns with the user's preference for a classic wooden rocking chair, enhancing the room's relaxing atmosphere.

The cushion is placed on the rocking chair to enhance comfort, respecting the user's input for a classic style. This placement ensures the cushion complements the rocking chair's functionality and aesthetic, maintaining coherence with the room's theme.

The rug is positioned in the middle of the room, serving as a central decorative element. Its dimensions (2.0m x 2.0m) allow it to enhance the room's aesthetic appeal and provide a visual anchor without interfering with the rocking chair's functionality.

The side table is placed to the right of the rocking chair, facing the north wall, ensuring accessibility and visual balance. Its compact size (0.627m x 0.621m x 0.836m) fits well next to the rocking chair, providing functional support for items while maintaining the room's classic style.

The vase is placed on the side table, facing the north wall, creating a visually balanced arrangement with the existing objects. Its placement ensures the room remains aesthetically pleasing and functional, aligning with the user's preference for a white ceramic vase with fresh flowers.

The flowers are placed inside the vase, enhancing the room's ambiance by adding color and life. Their height (0.3m) allows them to stand out without overwhelming the room's decor, complementing the vase and maintaining the room's balance.

The plant stand is positioned in the south-east corner of the room, facing the north wall. This placement utilizes space efficiently, adding visual height and maintaining balance with the existing furniture. Its classic style and black metal structure contribute to the room's ambiance and aesthetic variety.

The shelf is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, providing accessible storage space while maintaining aesthetic consistency with the room's classic theme. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.3m x 0.8m) ensure it fits well without obstructing the room's flow.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The objects were arranged to ensure spatial harmony and adherence to the user's preferences, maintaining a balance between functionality and aesthetics.
