## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a dining room that exudes hospitality and warmth, with a focus on functionality and aesthetics. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Central to the design is a wooden dining table, complemented by a set of black upholstered chairs and a red ceramic teapot. The user desires a space that is both elegant and practical, with additional seating options, sophisticated lighting, and storage solutions. A rug is suggested to define the dining area, while artwork or a decorative mirror could enhance visual interest. The inclusion of plants is recommended to introduce a natural element, contributing to the room's inviting atmosphere.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures. The Dining Area is the focal point, centered around the dining table and chairs. The Lighting Area is defined by the chandelier, providing essential illumination. The Storage Area, featuring a sideboard, offers space for dining ware and linens. The Aesthetic Enhancement Area includes a rug to define the dining space and a plant to add natural beauty. Each substructure is designed to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Dining Area, a contemporary wooden dining table (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.75m) is recommended, surrounded by four modern black upholstered chairs (each 0.5m x 0.5m x 0.9m). A traditional red ceramic teapot (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.15m) serves as a functional and decorative element. The Lighting Area features an elegant chandelier (0.8m x 0.8m x 1.0m) to provide ambient lighting. The Storage Area includes a classic wooden sideboard (1.5m x 0.5m x 0.8m) for organization. A minimalist wool rug (3.0m x 2.0m) defines the dining space, while a natural plant (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.2m) enhances the room's aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dining table is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall, to serve as the focal point and allow seating on all sides. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.75m) ensure it fits comfortably in the space, providing a functional and visually appealing gathering area. The central placement aligns with design principles of balance and symmetry, enhancing the room's hospitality.

Chair_1 is positioned to the left of the dining table, facing the east wall. This placement ensures no spatial conflicts and complements the table's style. Chair_2 is placed to the right of the table, facing the west wall, creating a balanced seating arrangement. Chair_3 is positioned in front of the table, facing the south wall, while Chair_4 is placed behind the table, facing the north wall. Each chair (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.9m) is arranged to maintain symmetry and functionality, providing comfortable seating for dining.

The teapot is placed on the dining table, centrally located for easy access from all chairs. Its small size (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.15m) ensures it does not obstruct dining activities, while its red color adds a vibrant contrast to the table's brown finish.

The chandelier is installed on the ceiling, directly above the dining table, to provide even lighting across the dining area. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.8m x 1.0m) are suitable for the room's height, ensuring it does not hang too low while enhancing the room's elegance.

The rug is placed under the dining table, defining the dining area and accommodating all chairs when pulled out. Its size (3.0m x 2.0m) ensures it fits well within the room, adding texture and warmth to the space.

The sideboard is positioned against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement maximizes space and accessibility, providing storage without disrupting the room's flow. Its classic wooden design complements the dining table, enhancing the room's cohesive look.

The plant is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, to add vertical interest and natural beauty. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.2m) make it suitable for this location, where it enhances the room's ambiance without obstructing functionality.

## 5. Global Check
There are no conflicts identified in the room layout, as all objects are placed with consideration for spatial relationships and user preferences. The arrangement ensures a harmonious balance between functionality and aesthetics, with each object contributing to the overall design without causing layout or size conflicts.
