## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions an artist's studio that incorporates specific elements such as an easel, a tall stool, and a wall-mounted display stand for artwork. The room is a square with dimensions of 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters and a height of 3.0 meters. The studio is designed to facilitate painting and creation, display completed artworks, and allow for observation and evaluation. The user emphasizes the need for functionality and aesthetic appeal, with additional suggestions for a storage unit for art supplies, a lighting fixture, a work table, and a rug to define the observation area.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The studio is divided into several substructures based on the user's requirements. The Easel and Stool Area along the north wall supports painting and creation, providing comfort and accessibility for the artist. The Display Stand Area on the south wall is designated for showcasing completed artworks, enhancing the studio's aesthetic. The Middle Observation Zone allows the artist to step back and evaluate their work, crucial for assessing progress. Additional areas include the Storage Area on the west wall for art supplies, the Lighting Area on the ceiling for adequate illumination, and the Work Table Area on the east wall for additional workspace.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Easel and Stool Area, a classic wooden easel (0.6m x 0.6m x 1.8m) and an industrial metal stool (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.75m) are recommended to support painting activities. The Display Stand Area features a modern glass display stand (1.2m x 0.1m x 1.8m) for artwork. The Storage Area includes a contemporary wooden storage unit (1.08m x 0.395m x 1.065m) for art supplies. The Lighting Area is equipped with a minimalist metal lighting fixture (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m) to ensure adequate lighting. The Work Table Area features a modern metal work table (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.75m) for workspace, and a bohemian fabric rug (2.0m x 1.5m) is recommended to define the observation area.

## 4. Scene Graph
The easel is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, as it is central to the artist's work and requires stability and good lighting. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 1.8m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, saving space in the middle of the room. This placement ensures the easel is easily accessible and well-lit, aligning with the user's vision of an artist's studio.

The stool is positioned in front of the easel, facing the north wall, to provide optimal functionality and ease of use. Its small dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.75m) ensure it fits comfortably without obstructing movement. This arrangement supports the artist's workflow and complements the existing studio setup.

The display stand is mounted on the south wall, facing the north wall, ensuring visibility while the artist is at the easel. Its modern style and glass material add aesthetic appeal to the studio. The stand's dimensions (1.2m x 0.1m x 1.8m) allow it to showcase artwork effectively without interfering with other objects.

The storage unit is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, providing easy access to art supplies without obstructing the view of the display stand or the easel. Its dimensions (1.08m x 0.395m x 1.065m) ensure it fits comfortably, maintaining the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The lighting fixture is installed on the ceiling, directly above the middle of the room, ensuring it illuminates the easel and stool area effectively. Its small size (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m) ensures it does not visually overwhelm the space, providing necessary lighting for art creation.

The work table is placed on the east wall, facing the north wall, ensuring accessibility and maintaining a cohesive aesthetic. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.75m) allow it to complement the existing layout without obstructing access to other elements, enhancing the studio's functionality.

The rug is placed in the middle of the room, under the stool, visually connecting it with the easel. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m) allow it to define the central working space, enhancing comfort and aesthetic appeal without obstructing movement.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed in a manner that avoids spatial conflicts and aligns with the user's vision of a cohesive artist's studio. The arrangement maintains balance and functionality, ensuring the studio is both aesthetically pleasing and practical for the artist's needs.
