## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a gaming room designed for an immersive experience, emphasizing comfort and sound quality. Key components include a high-back gaming chair, a broad desk, and a speaker set. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, is intended to support long hours of gameplay with ergonomic seating and strategic sound placement. Additional elements like a gaming monitor, mechanical keyboard, mouse, and LED strip lighting are suggested to enhance functionality and aesthetics, creating a dynamic and engaging ambiance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Seating Area is centered around the gaming chair, providing ergonomic support for extended gaming sessions. The Desk Area is designated for the gaming desk, which will hold essential equipment like the monitor and keyboard. The Audio Area focuses on the strategic placement of the speaker set to optimize sound quality. Lastly, the Lighting Area is designed to enhance ambiance with LED strip lighting, contributing to the immersive gaming environment.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a modern-style, ergonomic leather gaming chair in black is recommended, measuring 0.627 meters by 0.603 meters by 0.778 meters. The Desk Area features a broad gaming desk, essential for holding the monitor, keyboard, and other gaming peripherals. The Audio Area includes a compact speaker set, strategically placed for optimal sound distribution. The Lighting Area is enhanced with a multicolor LED strip, providing ambiance lighting to elevate the gaming experience.

## 4. Scene Graph
The gaming chair, a central element of the setup, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures ergonomic seating for future gaming activities, allowing the user to have a full view of the room. The chair's dimensions (0.627m x 0.603m x 0.778m) fit comfortably in this location, providing a balanced visual anchor without blocking pathways or future placements of objects like the desk or speakers.

The LED strip is installed on the ceiling, running parallel to the north and south walls. This placement enhances the room's ambiance without occupying valuable floor or wall space. The LED strip's dimensions (2.018m x 0.492m x 0.085m) allow it to provide indirect illumination, aligning with the user's preference for an immersive gaming experience and maintaining the room's aesthetic balance.

## 5. Global Check
Conflicts arose due to the limited space on the gaming desk, which could not accommodate all intended objects, including the speaker set, monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Additionally, the gaming chair's length was insufficient to accommodate the desk in front of it. To resolve these conflicts, the speaker set, mouse, keyboard, and monitor were removed, prioritizing the essential elements of the gaming chair and LED strip to maintain the room's functionality and user preferences.
