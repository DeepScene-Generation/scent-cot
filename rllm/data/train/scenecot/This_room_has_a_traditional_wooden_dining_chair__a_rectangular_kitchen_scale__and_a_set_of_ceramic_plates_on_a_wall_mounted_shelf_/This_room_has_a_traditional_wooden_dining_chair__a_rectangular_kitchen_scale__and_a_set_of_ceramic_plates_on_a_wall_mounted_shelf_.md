## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user's input specifies a 5.0m x 5.0m room intended for dining and cooking, with a preference for traditional wooden furniture. Key elements include a kitchen scale for precise measurement and a wall-mounted shelf for displaying ceramic plates. The user desires a space that balances functionality with aesthetic appeal, emphasizing traditional design elements while incorporating modern conveniences.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three primary areas: the Kitchen Scale Area, Dining Chair Area, and Wall-Mounted Shelf Area. The Kitchen Scale Area is designed to support precise measurement tasks, ideally with an ergonomic kitchen counter or island. The Dining Chair Area focuses on providing a complete dining setup with traditional wooden furniture. The Wall-Mounted Shelf Area is intended for organizing and displaying ceramic plates, enhancing the room's visual appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Kitchen Scale Area, a modern metal kitchen scale is recommended, emphasizing functionality and ease of use. The Dining Chair Area should feature a traditional wooden dining chair, complemented by a matching dining table to complete the setup. The Wall-Mounted Shelf Area requires a modern wooden wall-mounted shelf to display ceramic plates, adding to the room's aesthetic. Additional recommendations include a rug under the dining area, decorative lighting, and a small plant to enhance warmth and charm.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dining chair, a traditional wooden piece, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement anticipates future additions like a dining table, aligning with the user's traditional theme and ensuring balance and proportion in the room. The chair's dimensions are 0.368m x 0.404m x 0.837m, and it serves as a seating object in the dining area.

The kitchen scale, a modern metal object, is placed on a shelf along the south wall, facing the north wall. This location ensures accessibility and aligns with typical kitchen setups, providing balance and functionality. The scale's dimensions are 0.3m x 0.2m x 0.1m, and it enhances the kitchen environment by being easily accessible for use.

The wall-mounted shelf, a modern wooden piece, is installed on the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement avoids spatial conflicts and serves as a focal point for displaying ceramic plates. The shelf's dimensions are 2.069m x 0.284m x 1.923m, and it is mounted at an optimal height for visibility and access, enhancing the room's aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
Conflicts arose due to the limited space available for the kitchen counter and dining table. The kitchen counter's placement next to the kitchen scale on the south wall was problematic due to insufficient width, leading to its removal. Similarly, the dining table's placement in front of the dining chair was infeasible due to space constraints, resulting in its deletion. These adjustments prioritized the room's traditional elements and functionality, ensuring a cohesive and practical layout.
