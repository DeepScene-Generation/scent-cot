## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a chic beauty salon characterized by a minimalist yet luxurious ambiance. Key elements include a black and white ceramic washbasin, a large mirror with a wooden frame, and a plush salon chair. The salon's design must accommodate these features while maintaining a modern aesthetic. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for the desired layout. The user emphasizes the importance of functionality and aesthetic appeal, aiming for a salon that is both stylish and practical.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The salon is divided into several functional substructures: the washbasin area, styling area, seating area, mirror setup, and a central open area. The washbasin area is dedicated to hair washing and requires plumbing access. The styling area includes a large mirror and possibly a side table or trolley for organizing tools. The seating area focuses on client comfort with a plush salon chair, potentially accompanied by a footrest. The mirror setup is a central feature for both function and aesthetics. The central open area remains uncluttered, potentially featuring a decorative plant or artwork to enhance the salon's ambiance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the washbasin area, a modern black and white ceramic washbasin is recommended, measuring 0.8 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.9 meters. The styling area should include a large mirror with a wooden frame, measuring 1.5 meters by 2.0 meters. The seating area features a plush salon chair, complemented by a footrest for added comfort. A modern trolley for styling tools is suggested for functionality. A decorative plant and a piece of modern multicolor artwork are recommended to enhance the salon's aesthetic without compromising space.

## 4. Scene Graph
The washbasin, a central element of the salon, is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. This positioning ensures it is a focal point upon entering the room, accessible for use, and allows for plumbing installation. The washbasin's dimensions (0.8m x 0.5m x 0.9m) fit comfortably against the wall, maintaining balance and proportion within the room. Its placement enhances the aesthetic appeal by serving as a central piece upon entering the salon.

The artwork, identified as 'artwork_1', is mounted on the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement ensures it does not occupy floor space and complements the overall modern aesthetic of the salon. The artwork's dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.7m) allow it to be a focal point without overwhelming the space, adding a splash of color and enhancing the salon's chic ambiance.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to spatial constraints and the need to maintain a chic aesthetic. The salon chair initially conflicted with the mirror's placement, as it would be out of bounds. To resolve this, the chair was repositioned to face the mirror directly, ensuring it remains functional and aesthetically pleasing. Additionally, the footrest and trolley were removed to prevent overcrowding and maintain the salon's open and luxurious feel. The final arrangement prioritizes essential elements like the washbasin, mirror, and salon chair, aligning with the user's preferences for a chic beauty salon.
