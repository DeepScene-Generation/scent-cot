## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a modern entryway that balances functionality with aesthetic appeal. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user has specified a preference for a wooden coat stand, a sleek console table, and a geometric rug, emphasizing a modern style. Additional suggestions include a mirror for aesthetic enhancement and practical use, as well as a bench for seating convenience. The room layout consists of six elements: south wall, north wall, west wall, east wall, middle of the room, and ceiling, which guide the placement of objects to ensure a cohesive and functional design.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main substructures based on the user's requirements: the Coat Stand Area, the Console Table Area, and the Geometric Rug Area. The Coat Stand Area, located against the south wall, is designated for hanging coats and hats, contributing to the room's modern aesthetic. The Console Table Area, also along the south wall, is intended for storing keys and decorative items, balancing functionality with modern design. The Geometric Rug Area, situated in the center of the room, provides comfort and visual interest, defining the entryway space.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Coat Stand Area, a modern wooden coat stand with dimensions of 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.8 meters is recommended. In the Console Table Area, a sleek console table measuring 1.2 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.8 meters is proposed to store keys and decorative items. The Geometric Rug Area features a geometric rug with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters, enhancing comfort and visual appeal. Additional recommendations include a mirror (0.8 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.2 meters) above the console table, a bench (1.0 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.45 meters) for seating, a decorative bowl (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.15 meters) on the console table, an umbrella stand (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.6 meters) near the coat stand, and wall art (1.0 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.8 meters) on the east wall.

## 4. Scene Graph
The coat stand is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, as it is a functional piece for hanging coats and hats. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.8m) allow it to fit comfortably without overpowering the space. This placement ensures easy access upon entering the room, aligning with the user's vision for a modern entryway. The console table is positioned on the south wall, to the right of the coat stand, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.4m x 0.8m) fit comfortably, providing a functional surface for keys and decor while maintaining a sleek entryway. The geometric rug is centrally placed on the floor, facing the south wall, in front of the console table and coat stand. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m) allow it to fit comfortably without overlapping other objects, enhancing the entryway's aesthetic and providing comfort underfoot.

The mirror is mounted on the south wall, directly above the console table, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.05m x 1.2m) fit well above the console table, enhancing the aesthetic appeal and providing practical use for appearance checks. The bench is placed to the left of the geometric rug, facing the north wall, without overlapping any existing objects. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.4m x 0.45m) allow it to fit comfortably, providing a functional seating area that complements the modern style. The decorative bowl is placed on the console table on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its small size (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.15m) allows it to fit without spatial conflicts, adding functionality and aesthetic appeal. The umbrella stand is placed on the south wall, left of the coat stand, facing the north wall. Its compact dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) ensure it fits without conflicting with other objects, maintaining a clean and organized appearance. Wall art is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.8m) ensure no spatial conflicts, adding decorative interest without overcrowding the main focal wall.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The arrangement of objects ensures a modern, functional entryway that aligns with the user's preferences and design principles. Each object is placed to maintain balance, proportion, and accessibility, ensuring a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing environment.
