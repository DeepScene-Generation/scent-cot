## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions an art studio that maximizes natural light and provides a functional yet aesthetically pleasing environment. The studio is designed to include key areas such as easel placement, seating for painting, a display for artworks, and open space for movement. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes the importance of a large wooden easel, a set of canvas paintings, and a wooden stool, all contributing to a bright and inviting art studio atmosphere.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The art studio is divided into several functional substructures based on user requirements. The north wall is designated for the easel, which is crucial for supporting large canvas paintings and benefits from optimal lighting. The east wall serves as a gallery space for displaying completed artworks, enhancing the studio's artistic ambiance. The central open space is reserved for unrestricted movement, essential for accessing painting tools and fostering creativity. The south wall, with large windows, maximizes natural lighting, although no objects are placed directly in front of it to maintain visibility and ambiance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the north wall, a traditional wooden easel is recommended to support large canvas paintings. A rustic wooden stool is suggested for comfortable seating during painting sessions, placed in front of the easel. A modern metal painting shelf is proposed for the east wall to display artworks. A bohemian-style floor rug is recommended for the middle of the room to enhance comfort and add a touch of color. Finally, a contemporary metal supply caddy is suggested to store painting supplies, positioned adjacent to the stool for easy access.

## 4. Scene Graph
The easel, a traditional wooden piece, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement maximizes natural light without direct sunlight, ideal for painting. The easel's dimensions are 0.7 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.8 meters, allowing it to fit comfortably against the wall while remaining accessible and not interfering with other placements. The stool, rustic in style, is positioned on the floor in front of the easel, facing the south wall. Its dimensions are 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.5 meters, ensuring it fits comfortably without overlapping with the easel. This placement provides functional seating for painting and maintains the studio's aesthetic harmony.

The painting shelf, modern and made of metal, is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions are 1.5 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.0 meters, allowing it to fit against the wall without congestion. This placement enhances the studio's artistic ambiance by prominently displaying artworks. The floor rug, with its bohemian style, is placed in the middle of the room, under the stool. Its dimensions are 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters, providing a comfortable area for the artist to work without obstructing movement. The supply caddy, contemporary in style, is placed on the floor adjacent to the right of the stool, facing the south wall. Its dimensions are 0.5 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.4 meters, ensuring easy access to painting supplies while maintaining the studio's functional flow.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the easel's capacity to accommodate multiple canvases. The easel's area was too small to support all four canvases simultaneously. To resolve this, canvas_4 was removed, as it was deemed the least important for maintaining the user's preference for a bright art studio with a large wooden easel and a set of canvas paintings. This adjustment ensures the studio remains functional and aesthetically aligned with the user's vision.
