            - x_max = 2.5 + 1 * 5.0/2 + -1 * 1.0/2 = 4.5
            - y_min = 5.0 + -1 * 0.0/2 + -1 * 0.05/2 = 4.975
            - y_max = 5.0 + -1 * 0.0/2 + -1 * 0.05/2 = 4.975
            - z_min = 1.5 - 3.0/2 + 1.5/2 = 0.75
            - z_max = 1.5 + 3.0/2 - 1.5/2 = 2.25
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.5, 4.5, 4.975, 4.975, 0.75, 2.25)
    3. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.5-4.5), y(4.975-4.975)
            - Final coordinates: x=1.603, y=4.975, z=1.245
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 1.603, y: 4.975, z: 1.245
    4. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    5. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Final coordinates: x=1.603, y=4.975, z=1.245
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 1.603, y: 4.975, z: 1.245
