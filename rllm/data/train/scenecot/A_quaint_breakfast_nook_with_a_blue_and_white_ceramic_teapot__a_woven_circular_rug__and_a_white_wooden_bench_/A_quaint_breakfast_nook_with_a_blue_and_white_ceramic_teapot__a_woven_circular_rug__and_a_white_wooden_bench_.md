## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a quaint breakfast nook characterized by a blue and white ceramic teapot, a woven circular rug, and a white wooden bench. The room's dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters. The design emphasizes aesthetic harmony, ergonomic seating, and functional space. The user desires a cozy and inviting atmosphere, with additional elements such as a small table, cushions for added comfort, wall art for personality, and a storage unit for breakfast essentials. The overall goal is to maintain a balance between functionality and aesthetics without cluttering the space.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key areas to fulfill the user's requirements. The Seating Area is defined by the placement of the white wooden bench against the east wall, serving as the primary seating component. The Central Area is marked by the woven circular rug, which adds warmth and texture to the space. The Decorative Area includes wall art on the south wall, enhancing the room's personality. The Storage Area is located adjacent to the bench, providing space for breakfast essentials. Each substructure is designed to contribute to the overall cozy and inviting atmosphere of the breakfast nook.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a rustic white wooden bench is recommended, providing ergonomic and durable seating. The Central Area features a bohemian-style woven circular rug, measuring 2.0 meters in diameter, to define the space and add texture. A classic blue and white ceramic teapot serves as a focal point, enhancing the cozy atmosphere. A minimalist round table, 0.6 meters in diameter, is suggested for holding breakfast items. Bohemian-style cushions are recommended for the bench to enhance comfort and style. Contemporary wall art with a blue and white color scheme is proposed for the Decorative Area. A modern white wooden storage unit, measuring 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.8 meters, is recommended for the Storage Area to keep essentials organized.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden bench is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, as it serves as the central seating feature in the breakfast nook. Its rustic style and white color are highlighted by this placement, which also allows for easy integration with additional elements like a table or rug. The bench's dimensions are 1.5 meters in length, 0.5 meters in width, and 0.45 meters in height, ensuring it fits comfortably against the wall without obstructing movement.

The circular rug is centrally placed in the room, serving as a focal point that enhances the cozy atmosphere. Its dimensions of 2.0 meters in diameter ensure it does not overlap with the bench or extend too close to the walls, maintaining openness and balance. This placement defines the seating area and complements the overall aesthetic.

The ceramic teapot is positioned on an imaginary side table or ledge to the right of the wooden bench, facing the north wall. This placement ensures the teapot is visible and accessible, contributing to the quaint atmosphere. Its small size, 0.3 meters in length, 0.2 meters in width, and 0.25 meters in height, allows it to fit comfortably without obstructing pathways.

The round table is placed in front of the wooden bench, on the circular rug, and facing the north wall. This configuration creates a functional breakfast nook by aligning the table with the bench and enhancing the room's aesthetic. The table's dimensions, 0.6 meters in diameter and 0.5 meters in height, ensure it fits comfortably within the space.

Cushion_1 is placed on the wooden bench, enhancing seating comfort while maintaining the room's aesthetic. Its bohemian style and blue color complement the existing decor. The cushion's dimensions, 0.4 meters in length, 0.4 meters in width, and 0.1 meters in height, ensure it fits comfortably on the bench without spatial conflicts.

The wall art is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, providing a decorative element that complements the existing blue and white theme. Its dimensions, 1.0 meters in length and 0.7 meters in height, allow for adequate placement without overwhelming the space.

The storage unit is placed to the right of the wooden bench against the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement maintains visual harmony and provides easy access to storage while keeping the breakfast area cozy and uncluttered. The storage unit's dimensions, 0.6 meters in length, 0.4 meters in width, and 0.8 meters in height, ensure it fits comfortably without disrupting the room's flow.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified regarding the placement of multiple cushions on the wooden bench. The bench's area was insufficient to accommodate both cushion_1 and cushion_2 alongside the ceramic teapot. To resolve this, cushion_2 was removed, as it was deemed less critical to the user's preference for a quaint breakfast nook. This decision ensured the bench remained functional and aesthetically pleasing, aligning with the user's vision and maintaining the room's overall harmony.

        - conclusion: Final position: x: 4.794349653776393, y: 2.758033508536059, z: 0.5
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=4.794349653776393, y=2.758033508536059, z=0.5
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 4.794349653776393, y: 2.758033508536059, z: 0.5
