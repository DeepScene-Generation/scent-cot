## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a chic boutique characterized by a polished display stand, bright spotlight, and fashionable mannequins. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user desires a modern aesthetic with functional elements such as a display stand for fashion items, mannequins for showcasing clothing, and a spotlight for highlighting displays. Additional elements like a decorative mirror, seating, and a decorative plant are suggested to enhance the boutique's ambiance and functionality.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Central Display Area is designated for the display stand, serving as the focal point for fashion items. The East and West Wall Areas accommodate mannequins, creating a balanced visual display. The Ceiling Area is reserved for the spotlight to illuminate the display stand. The South Wall Area features a decorative mirror and a bench, providing a functional and aesthetic backdrop. The North Wall Area is utilized for a decorative plant, adding a natural element to the room.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Central Display Area, a modern, polished metal display stand measuring 1.5 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.9 meters is recommended. The East and West Wall Areas feature modern fiberglass mannequins, each measuring 0.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.8 meters, to showcase clothing. The Ceiling Area includes a modern chrome spotlight (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.2 meters) to highlight the display stand. The South Wall Area is enhanced with a modern glass decorative mirror (1.2 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.8 meters) and a stylish bench (1.2 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.45 meters) for customer seating. A decorative plant (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter) is recommended for the North Wall Area to improve ambiance. A modern fabric rug (2.0 meters by 1.5 meters) is suggested to define the display area.

## 4. Scene Graph
The display stand is placed in the middle of the room, serving as the central feature for displaying fashion items. Its dimensions (1.5m x 1.0m x 0.9m) allow it to be the focal point, accessible from all sides, and visible throughout the room. This placement aligns with the chic boutique theme, ensuring the display stand is prominent and functional.

Mannequin_1 is positioned against the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement enhances the boutique's aesthetic while ensuring functionality for displaying clothing. The mannequin's dimensions (0.5m x 0.4m x 1.8m) allow it to serve as a focal point without obstructing the display stand's visibility or access.

Mannequin_2 is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, creating a balanced aesthetic and ensuring visibility from the center of the room. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.4m x 1.8m) complement mannequin_1 and the display stand, contributing to the boutique's chic appearance.

The ceiling spotlight is centrally located on the ceiling, directly above the display stand, to ensure optimal lighting. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.2m) and chrome finish complement the modern style, highlighting the display stand and enhancing the room's aesthetic.

The decorative mirror is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.05m x 1.8m) allow it to enhance visualization and reflect light, creating an illusion of a larger space while maintaining aesthetic coherence.

The bench is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.5m x 0.45m) ensure it complements the decorative mirror, providing a functional seating area without disrupting the visual flow of the boutique.

The decorative plant is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) allow it to add a natural element to the room's ambiance, maintaining balance and ensuring visibility without hindering movement or focus on the display stand.

The rug is placed on the floor in the middle of the room, directly under the display stand. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m) enhance the central area, drawing attention to the display stand and supporting the overall aesthetic and functionality of the room.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects are positioned to avoid spatial conflicts, align with the user's vision of a chic boutique, and adhere to design principles. The room's layout ensures functionality and aesthetic appeal, with each object contributing to the boutique's ambiance and usability.
