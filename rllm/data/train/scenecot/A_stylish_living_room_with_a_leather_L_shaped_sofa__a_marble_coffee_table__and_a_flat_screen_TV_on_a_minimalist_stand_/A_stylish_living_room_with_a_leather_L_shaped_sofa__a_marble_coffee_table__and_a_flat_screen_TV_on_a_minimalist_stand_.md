## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a stylish living room featuring a leather L-shaped sofa, a marble coffee table, and a flat-screen TV on a minimalist stand. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, is designed to emphasize modern aesthetics and functionality. Key elements include a seating area defined by the luxurious sofa, a central area for social interaction around the coffee table, and a TV viewing area with an unobstructed view. The room also benefits from natural light through a window on the east wall, enhancing the ambiance. Additional items such as a rug, an armchair, a floor lamp, and wall art are considered to complete the room's stylish and functional design.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The living room is divided into several functional substructures. The Seating Area is centered around the L-shaped sofa, providing ergonomic and stylish seating for multiple people. The Central Area features the marble coffee table, serving as a gathering point for social interactions. The TV Viewing Area is designed to ensure an unobstructed view of the TV, maintaining the room's aesthetic balance. The Window Area on the east wall enhances natural light, contributing to the room's ambiance. Additional substructures include a Rug Area to define the seating space, an Armchair Area for extra seating, a Lighting Area for enhanced illumination, and a Wall Art Area to add personality and style.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a modern leather L-shaped sofa measuring 2.5 meters by 2.0 meters by 0.8 meters is recommended. The Central Area features a marble coffee table with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters. The TV Viewing Area includes a minimalist wooden TV stand (1.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.5 meters) and a modern flat-screen TV (0.92 meters by 0.089 meters by 0.51 meters). A contemporary fabric rug (2.0 meters by 1.5 meters) defines the seating area, while a modern leather armchair (0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 1.0 meters) provides additional seating. A modern metal floor lamp (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.5 meters) enhances lighting, and modern canvas wall art (1.0 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.8 meters) adds decorative flair.

## 4. Scene Graph
The L-shaped sofa is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to maximize space usage and support its aesthetic appeal. This placement ensures the sofa serves as a focal point, providing ample seating and room for other elements. The coffee table is positioned in front of the sofa, centrally aligned to facilitate easy access and maintain balance. Its marble material complements the leather sofa, enhancing the room's modern style. The TV stand is placed on the north wall, directly opposite the sofa, ensuring optimal viewing. The TV is placed on the stand, maintaining alignment and contributing to the room's stylish aesthetic. The rug is placed under the coffee table, extending slightly beyond its edges to define the seating area and enhance the room's cohesion. The armchair is positioned to the right of the sofa, facing the west wall, providing additional seating without obstructing the view to the TV. The floor lamp is placed adjacent to the armchair, facing the east wall, to provide direct lighting for the seating area. Finally, the wall art is hung on the south wall above the sofa, enhancing the room's visual appeal and serving as a decorative focal point.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The arrangement of objects ensures a harmonious and functional living room layout, adhering to the user's preferences and design principles. Each object is strategically placed to maintain balance, proportion, and accessibility, contributing to the overall stylish and modern aesthetic of the room.
