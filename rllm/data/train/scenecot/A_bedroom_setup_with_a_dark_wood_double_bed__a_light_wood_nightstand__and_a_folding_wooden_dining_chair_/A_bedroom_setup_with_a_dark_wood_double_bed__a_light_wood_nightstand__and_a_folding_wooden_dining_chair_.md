## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a bedroom that is both warm and inviting, with a focus on functionality. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a double bed, a nightstand, and a folding chair, all contributing to a cohesive and functional space. The user prefers a mix of dark and light wood tones to create a soft contrast, enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal. The overall design should maintain an open feel, with a maximum of 12 objects to avoid clutter.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main substructures: the Bed Area, Nightstand Area, and Seating Area. The Bed Area is the central zone, featuring a dark wood double bed as the primary sleeping element. The Nightstand Area, adjacent to the bed, provides space for nighttime essentials and adds a contrasting light wood element. The Seating Area includes a folding chair, offering a temporary seating option that maintains the room's openness when not in use.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Bed Area, a classic dark wood double bed frame with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.8 meters by 0.4 meters is recommended, paired with a modern memory foam mattress measuring 2.0 meters by 1.8 meters by 0.2 meters. The Nightstand Area features a modern light wood nightstand (0.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.6 meters) to hold essentials, complemented by a modern metal lamp (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters) for lighting. The Seating Area includes a rustic folding wooden chair (0.503 meters by 0.639 meters by 0.973 meters) for flexible seating. Additional elements include a bohemian wool rug (2.997 meters by 1.962 meters) for comfort, a classic dark wood dresser (1.0 meter by 0.5 meter by 1.0 meter) for storage, and modern canvas artwork (1.0 meter by 0.05 meter by 0.7 meter) for decoration.

## 4. Scene Graph
The bed frame is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, as it is the central element of the bedroom. This placement ensures stability and maximizes space efficiency, allowing for easy movement around the room. The bed's dimensions (2.0m x 1.8m x 0.4m) fit well within the room's layout, providing symmetry and balance. The mattress is placed directly on the bed frame, matching its dimensions (2.0m x 1.8m x 0.2m) to ensure a perfect fit and maintain the room's functionality as a sleeping area.

The nightstand is positioned on the floor, adjacent to the east side of the bed frame, facing the north wall. This placement allows for easy access to essentials from the bed and maintains the room's aesthetic balance with its light wood contrasting the dark wood bed. The lamp is placed on the nightstand, providing necessary lighting without spatial conflicts, and aligns with the user's preference for a bedside setup.

The folding chair is placed at the foot of the bed, facing the north wall. This location ensures the chair is accessible and functional without obstructing pathways or the view of other objects in the room. The chair's rustic style complements the existing wood tones, enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal. The rug is placed in the middle of the room under the folding chair, oriented parallel to the bed and other furniture. This placement enhances comfort and ties the room elements together aesthetically without interfering with other objects.

The dresser is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall, away from the bed and nightstand. This positioning allows easy access to its drawers and maintains room balance and functionality. The dresser's classic style complements the existing dark wood elements, aligning with the user's vision of a classic style bedroom. The artwork is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, ensuring visibility and adding an aesthetic touch without interfering with other elements in the room.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The arrangement of objects adheres to the user's preferences and design principles, ensuring functionality and aesthetic appeal without spatial conflicts. Each object is strategically placed to maintain an open feel and enhance the room's overall design.
