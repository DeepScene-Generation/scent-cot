## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a cozy reading corner within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary focus is on creating a comfortable and aesthetically pleasing space that includes a chaise lounge and a small round side table. The user emphasizes the importance of ergonomic comfort for extended reading sessions, adequate lighting, and maintaining an uncluttered central space. Additional elements such as a plush rug, decorative items like a candle or plant, and a bookshelf are suggested to enhance the ambiance and functionality of the reading corner.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into specific substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The Reading Corner is the primary substructure, located in the south-west corner, designed to house the chaise lounge and side table. The Lighting Area is adjacent to the Reading Corner, ensuring sufficient illumination for reading. The Decorative Area includes elements like a candle and plant to enhance the ambiance. The central space remains open to maintain a peaceful environment, while the Storage Area, initially intended for a bookshelf, is reconsidered due to spatial constraints.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Reading Corner, a cozy fabric chaise lounge (1.6m x 0.8m x 0.85m) is recommended, complemented by a modern oak side table (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.5m). A minimalist black metal floor lamp (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.8m) is suggested for the Lighting Area. A bohemian wool rug (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.01m) is proposed to enhance comfort. Decorative elements include a rustic white wax candle (0.058m x 0.058m x 0.028m) and a natural green ceramic plant (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.8m). A throw blanket was initially considered but later removed due to spatial constraints.

## 4. Scene Graph
The chaise lounge is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to create a defined reading corner. Its dimensions (1.6m x 0.8m x 0.85m) ensure it fits comfortably without obstructing movement, aligning with the user's preference for a cozy corner. The side table is positioned to the right of the chaise lounge, providing a convenient surface for personal items. Its small size (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.5m) ensures it does not overwhelm the space. The floor lamp is placed to the left of the chaise lounge, providing direct lighting without obstructing the side table. Its placement maintains balance and functionality. The rug is placed under both the chaise lounge and side table, integrating it into the reading corner and enhancing comfort. The candle is placed on the side table, contributing to the ambiance without disrupting the layout. The plant is positioned on the floor to the left of the chaise lounge, adding a natural element to the reading corner. The bookshelf was initially considered for the south wall but was removed due to spatial constraints.

## 5. Global Check
Two conflicts were identified during the placement process. The first conflict involved the chaise lounge area being too small to accommodate all intended objects, leading to the removal of the throw blanket, which was deemed less critical for the user's preference and room functionality. The second conflict arose from the south wall being unable to accommodate all planned objects, resulting in the removal of the bookshelf. This decision was made to prioritize the chaise lounge and side table, which are central to the user's vision of a cozy reading corner.
