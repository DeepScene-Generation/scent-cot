## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a cozy reading nook within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary elements requested include a plush armchair, a round side table, and a floor lamp to create a comfortable and inviting space for relaxation and reading. The user emphasizes the need for comfort, functionality, and aesthetic harmony, with additional suggestions for a small bookshelf, a cozy rug, and decorative cushions to enhance the ambiance and provide a delightful reading experience.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to accommodate the user's requirements. The primary substructure is the Seating Area, which includes the plush armchair as the focal point. Adjacent to this is the Functional Area, where the side table and floor lamp are positioned to provide convenience and lighting. The Storage Area is designated for the bookshelf, offering easy access to books. Lastly, the Decorative Area is defined by the rug and cushions, adding warmth and comfort to the overall space.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a classic-style plush armchair made of fabric in beige is recommended, measuring 1.03 meters by 0.961 meters by 0.847 meters. The Functional Area includes a contemporary dark brown wooden side table (0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.5 meters) and a modern black metal floor lamp (0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.5 meters). The Storage Area features a modern white wooden bookshelf (0.8 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.8 meters) for book storage. The Decorative Area is enhanced with a bohemian multicolor wool rug (2.0 meters by 1.5 meters by 0.01 meters) and a modern red fabric cushion (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters) for added comfort.

## 4. Scene Graph
The armchair, a key element for creating a cozy reading nook, is placed against the south wall facing the north wall. This placement maximizes comfort and visual appeal, ensuring the armchair does not obstruct movement within the room. Its dimensions (1.03m x 0.961m x 0.847m) fit well against the wall, maintaining balance and proportion in the space.

The side table is positioned to the right of the armchair on the south wall, ensuring easy access for the person seated. Its compact size (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.5m) allows it to complement the armchair without causing spatial conflicts, adhering to the design principle of maintaining balance and proportion.

The floor lamp is placed to the left of the armchair on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures it provides adequate lighting for reading while maintaining a balanced layout. The lamp's height (1.5 meters) and modern style add sophistication and contrast to the nook.

The bookshelf, initially intended to be behind the armchair, is repositioned to the south wall to avoid spatial conflicts. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.3m x 1.8m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, providing a functional book storage solution without obstructing movement.

The rug is placed in the middle of the room, extending under the armchair, side table, and floor lamp. Its size (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.01m) ensures it does not interfere with the functionality of the furniture while adding warmth and aesthetic appeal to the space.

The cushion is placed on the armchair, enhancing seating comfort and adding a splash of color. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m) ensure it fits comfortably without causing spatial conflicts, aligning with the user's preference for a cozy and inviting atmosphere.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the initial placement of the bookshelf behind the armchair, as it would have been out of bounds. To resolve this, the bookshelf was repositioned to the south wall, ensuring it remains functional and aesthetically pleasing without obstructing movement. Additionally, the armchair was unable to accommodate both cushions, leading to the removal of cushion_2, as cushion_1 was deemed more important for maintaining the room's comfort and functionality.
