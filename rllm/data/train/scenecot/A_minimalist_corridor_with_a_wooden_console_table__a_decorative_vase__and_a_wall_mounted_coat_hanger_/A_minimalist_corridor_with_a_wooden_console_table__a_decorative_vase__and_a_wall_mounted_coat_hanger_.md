## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a minimalist corridor that emphasizes a clean and uncluttered aesthetic while incorporating specific functional elements. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key items requested include a wooden console table, a decorative vase, and a wall-mounted coat hanger, all of which should contribute to a simple yet elegant look. Additional elements such as a runner rug, wall mirror, minimalistic clock, and ambient lighting are suggested to enhance both functionality and aesthetic appeal, with a strict limit of 15 objects to maintain the minimalist theme.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The corridor is divided into several functional substructures. The Console Table Area is designated for decorative display, featuring the wooden console table and decorative vase. The Coat Hanging Area includes a wall-mounted coat hanger for practical storage of outerwear. The Passageway is an open space that ensures easy movement and a coherent visual experience. Additional substructures include the Floor Area, which accommodates a runner rug for warmth and texture, and the Wall Area, which supports a wall mirror and clock for added functionality and aesthetic enhancement.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Console Table Area, a minimalist wooden console table with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.8 meters is recommended, complemented by a decorative ceramic vase measuring 0.15 meters by 0.15 meters by 0.3 meters. The Coat Hanging Area features a minimalist metal coat hanger, 1.0 meter by 0.1 meter by 0.2 meter, mounted on the wall. The Floor Area includes a grey wool runner rug, 4.0 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.01 meters, to enhance the corridor's texture. The Wall Area is adorned with a glass wall mirror, 0.5 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.7 meters, and a plastic clock, 0.3 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.3 meters, both contributing to the minimalist aesthetic. Additionally, a metal ambient light, 0.1 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.3 meters, is placed to provide functional lighting.

## 4. Scene Graph
The console table, a central decorative element, is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its placement ensures visibility upon entering the corridor, aligning with the minimalist style and providing a focal point for decorative display. The table's oak color complements the minimalist aesthetic, and its dimensions (1.2m x 0.4m x 0.8m) fit well against the wall without spatial conflicts.

The decorative vase, a key element for adding sophistication, is placed on the console table. Its dimensions (0.15m x 0.15m x 0.3m) allow it to fit comfortably, serving as a focal point without overwhelming the space. The vase's white color contrasts with the oak table, enhancing visual appeal.

The coat hanger is mounted on the south wall above the console table, ensuring accessibility without obstructing the table or vase. Its metal material and black color provide contrast, enhancing visual interest. The hanger's dimensions (1.0m x 0.1m x 0.2m) ensure it does not interfere with other objects, maintaining the corridor's functionality and minimalist aesthetic.

The runner rug is centrally placed on the floor, parallel to the south wall. Its dimensions (4.0m x 0.8m x 0.01m) cover the passageway effectively, enhancing functionality without overcrowding the space. The rug's grey hue complements the existing color scheme, contributing to the corridor's aesthetic.

The wall mirror is placed above the console table on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.05m x 0.7m) allow it to fit comfortably without overlapping the vase, maintaining balance and aesthetic appeal. The mirror enhances the sense of space, aligning with the minimalist design.

The clock is placed on the south wall above the console table, aligned centrally for visual balance. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.05m x 0.3m) ensure it does not interfere with the coat hanger or mirror, maintaining the minimalist aesthetic and functionality.

The ambient light is placed on the floor to the left of the console table, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.1m x 0.1m x 0.3m) ensure it complements the existing decor without obstructing the corridor's flow. The light provides additional illumination, enhancing the minimalist aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were positioned to maintain the minimalist aesthetic and functionality, ensuring no spatial or size conflicts arose. The careful arrangement of objects, considering their dimensions and relationships, ensured a coherent and visually appealing corridor design.
