## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions an industrial-style loft characterized by raw and rugged materials such as metal, leather, and concrete. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a metal I-beam, a leather high-back chair, and a concrete coffee table. The user desires a space that balances aesthetic appeal with functionality, incorporating elements like a floor lamp for reading, decorative items to enhance the industrial theme, and a rug to add warmth and define the open movement area. Additional storage solutions and an industrial-themed art piece are also considered to enhance the room's functionality and visual interest.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to align with the user's industrial aesthetic and functional needs. The ceiling features a structural and aesthetic I-beam, while the seating area includes a leather high-back chair complemented by a floor lamp for reading. The central coffee table area serves as a focal point for relaxation and interaction. An open movement area is defined by a rug, adding warmth and contrast to the concrete elements. The east wall is designated for storage with a shelf, and the north wall is reserved for an industrial-themed art piece to enhance the room's visual appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the ceiling, a metal I-beam is recommended to emphasize the industrial style and provide structural support. The seating area includes a leather high-back chair and a metal floor lamp to enhance functionality and comfort. A concrete coffee table is central to the room, complemented by a decorative metal tray. A wool rug in charcoal color defines the open movement area, adding texture and warmth. A wood and metal shelf on the east wall provides storage and display options, while a metal art piece on the north wall enhances the room's aesthetic. The decorative metal tray and a small sculpture are suggested for the coffee table, though space constraints necessitate prioritizing the tray.

## 4. Scene Graph
The I-beam, a structural necessity, is placed on the ceiling, running parallel to the north and south walls. Its dimensions (3.326m x 0.205m x 0.237m) allow it to span the room's width without spatial conflicts, enhancing the industrial aesthetic while serving its structural purpose. The leather high-back chair, measuring 1.073m x 0.851m x 0.975m, is positioned against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement maintains an open space in the center, aligning with the loft's design principles and providing a comfortable view for relaxation. The concrete coffee table (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.4m) is centrally located in front of the chair, facilitating easy access and maintaining balance within the room. The floor lamp, with dimensions of 0.601m x 0.601m x 1.902m, is placed to the right of the chair along the south wall, providing functional lighting without obstructing movement. The rug, measuring 2.0m x 1.5m, is placed under the coffee table, defining the central space and enhancing the room's aesthetic. The shelf (1.0m x 0.3m x 2.0m) is positioned against the east wall, offering storage without interfering with the room's layout. The art piece (1.5m x 0.1m x 1.0m) is mounted on the north wall, serving as a focal point visible from the seating area. The decorative tray (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.05m) is placed on the coffee table, adding a touch of industrial elegance.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited surface area of the coffee table, which could not accommodate both the tray and the sculpture. To resolve this, the sculpture was removed, as the tray was deemed more essential for maintaining the industrial aesthetic and functionality of the room. This decision ensures the coffee table remains a versatile and visually appealing element within the space.

            - y_min = y_max = 4.95
            - z_min = 1.5 - 3.0/2 + 1.0/2 = 0.5
            - z_max = 1.5 + 3.0/2 - 1.0/2 = 2.5
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.75, 4.25, 4.95, 4.95, 0.5, 2.5)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.75-4.25), y(4.95-4.95)
        - conclusion: Final coordinates: x=1.8615, y=4.95, z=1.9753
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No other objects in the north_wall area
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Final coordinates: x=1.8615, y=4.95, z=1.9753
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 1.8615, y: 4.95, z: 1.9753
