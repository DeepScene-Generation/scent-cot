## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a game room that prominently features a pool table, a black leather gaming chair, and a white speaker set. The room is designed to be both functional and aesthetically pleasing, with a modern style. The dimensions of the room are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user has specified the need for a pool table as the central element, complemented by ergonomic seating and a high-quality audio system. Additional elements such as lighting fixtures, a wall-mounted TV, and extra seating options like bean bags are also desired to enhance the gaming atmosphere and provide a balanced aesthetic.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key substructures to accommodate the user's requirements. The Pool Table Area is central, providing ample space for gameplay. The Gaming Chair Area is positioned for ergonomic seating and relaxation. The Speaker Setup Area is designed to optimize sound quality, while the Entertainment Area includes a wall-mounted TV for visual engagement. Additional substructures include the Lighting Area for ambient illumination and the Seating Area, which offers extra seating with bean bags to enhance social interaction.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Pool Table Area, a modern-style pool table with dimensions of 2.7 meters by 1.5 meters by 0.8 meters is recommended. The Gaming Chair Area features a modern black leather gaming chair measuring 0.7 meters by 0.7 meters by 1.2 meters. The Speaker Setup Area includes a sleek, modern white speaker set with dimensions of 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.8 meters. The Entertainment Area is enhanced with a modern black TV, measuring 1.2 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.7 meters. The Lighting Area is equipped with a modern silver ceiling light, 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.3 meters, to provide balanced illumination. For the Seating Area, two casual fabric bean bags, each 0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.7 meters, are recommended for additional seating.

## 4. Scene Graph
The pool table is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall, as it is the focal point of the game room. Its dimensions (2.7m x 1.5m x 0.8m) allow for ample space around it, ensuring players can move freely. This central placement aligns with the user's preference for a game room centered around a pool table and adheres to design principles by maintaining balance and proportion.

The gaming chair is positioned against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures the chair does not obstruct the pool table's play area while providing a comfortable seating option for viewing the TV. The chair's dimensions (0.7m x 0.7m x 1.2m) fit well against the wall, maintaining open space around the pool table and adhering to the user's modern style preference.

The speaker set is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, to optimize audio distribution throughout the room. Its compact size (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.8m) allows it to fit comfortably without interfering with other objects. This placement complements the modern aesthetic and ensures the sound quality enhances the gaming experience.

The TV is mounted on the north wall, facing the south wall, providing a clear line of sight for users seated in the gaming chair. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.1m x 0.7m) ensure it does not obstruct the pool table or speaker set, maintaining a clean and organized look while enhancing the room's entertainment functionality.

The ceiling light is centrally located on the ceiling, providing balanced illumination across the room. Its small size (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.3m) ensures it does not conflict with other objects, and its modern style complements the room's aesthetic. This placement enhances the room's functionality by providing overhead lighting without obstructing the gaming area.

The blue bean bag is placed to the right of the pool table, facing the west wall, providing additional seating without obstructing movement or access to other elements. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.8m x 0.7m) ensure it fits comfortably in the space, complementing the room's casual style and maintaining an open flow.

The red bean bag is placed to the left of the pool table, facing the east wall, balancing the seating arrangement and maintaining an open flow around the room. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.8m x 0.7m) ensure it does not interfere with the pool table's playing area, enhancing the gaming experience while providing additional seating.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the placement of the gaming chair, which was too small to accommodate both the TV and the coffee table in front of it. To resolve this, the coffee table was removed, as it was deemed less critical to the user's preference and the room's functionality compared to the TV. This adjustment ensures the gaming chair maintains its functionality and aesthetic appeal without causing spatial conflicts.
