## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a rustic-style bedroom that emphasizes both functionality and aesthetics. Key elements include a wooden double bed, a matching dresser, and a soft rug to enhance warmth and comfort. The room's dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design aims to create a warm and inviting atmosphere, with additional elements like a bedside table, lamp, chair, mirror, and rustic wall art to enhance both functionality and visual appeal. The total number of objects should not exceed 14, ensuring a balance between fulfilling the user's needs and maintaining the room's rustic charm.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Sleeping Area features a wooden double bed against the south wall, serving as the focal point for rest and sleep. The Storage Area includes a matching wooden dresser along the east wall for storing clothes and personal items. The Floor Area is enhanced with a soft rug for added warmth and comfort, aligning with the rustic theme. Additional elements include a Bedside Area with a table and lamp for convenience and lighting, a Seating Area with a chair for relaxation, and a Dressing Area with a mirror for personal grooming. Decorative elements like rustic wall art are included to enhance the room's aesthetic appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sleeping Area, a rustic-style wooden double bed measuring 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters is recommended. The Storage Area features a matching wooden dresser with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter. The Floor Area includes a soft wool rug measuring 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters, providing warmth and comfort. The Bedside Area is equipped with a rustic wooden bedside table (0.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.6 meters) and a bronze lamp (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters) for lighting. The Seating Area includes a rustic wooden chair, while the Dressing Area features a rustic-style mirror (0.8 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.2 meters) mounted above the dresser. Finally, rustic wall art (1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 0.7 meters) is recommended for the west wall to enhance the room's visual appeal.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden bed is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, as it serves as the room's focal point and aligns with the user's rustic theme. This placement provides stability and allows for optimal space utilization, ensuring easy access and visual appeal. The bed's dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.5m) fit comfortably within the room, maintaining balance and proportion.

The wooden dresser is positioned on the east wall, facing the west wall, complementing the rustic style and providing functional storage space. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.5m x 1.0m) ensure it does not obstruct pathways, maintaining balance and accessibility within the room.

The rug is placed on the floor in front of the bed, enhancing comfort and aligning with the rustic theme. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.02m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing movement or access to the dresser, providing a soft surface to step onto.

The bedside table is placed to the left of the bed, adjacent to it, and facing the north wall. This placement ensures functional use with the bed, maintaining the room's rustic aesthetic and avoiding spatial conflicts. The table's dimensions (0.5m x 0.4m x 0.6m) fit comfortably next to the bed.

The lamp is placed on the bedside table, facing the north wall, providing convenient lighting for the bed. Its small footprint (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) ensures it does not cause clutter, aligning with the rustic theme and enhancing usability.

The mirror is mounted on the east wall, directly above the dresser, facing the west wall. This placement complements the dresser's functionality and aesthetic appeal, maintaining balance and proportion in the room. The mirror's dimensions (0.8m x 0.05m x 1.2m) ensure it does not occupy floor space.

The wall art is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, enhancing the room's visual balance and rustic ambiance. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.7m) ensure it does not interfere with other furniture or decor, adding decorative appeal to the room.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the placement of the chair, as the width of the wooden dresser was too small to accommodate the chair to its left. To resolve this, the chair was removed, as it was deemed less critical to the user's preference for a rustic-style bedroom with a wooden double bed, matching dresser, and soft rug. This resolution maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal without overcrowding.
