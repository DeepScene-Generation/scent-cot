## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a modern home office that emphasizes functionality and a minimalist style, with a specific color palette of black, white, and gray. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a sleek black desk, a white ergonomic chair, and a gray metal filing cabinet, which are essential for the office's function and aesthetic. The workspace is centered around the desk, positioned against the south wall, serving as the main area for computer work and paperwork. The ergonomic chair enhances comfort for extended work sessions, while the filing cabinet is crucial for storage, maintaining organization, and a clutter-free environment. Additional objects should complement the modern aesthetic and functionality without disrupting the minimalist decor.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main substructures based on user requirements. The Workspace Area is centered around the desk, which is positioned against the north wall, serving as the primary zone for computer work and paperwork. The Seating Area is defined by the ergonomic chair placed in front of the desk, ensuring comfort and functionality. The Storage Area is designated by the filing cabinet against the east wall, providing essential storage for documents and office supplies. These substructures ensure the room remains uncluttered and efficient, aligning with the user's preferences for a modern home office.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Workspace Area, a modern black desk with dimensions of 1.5 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended, serving as the main workspace. The Seating Area features a white ergonomic chair measuring 0.879 meters by 0.672 meters by 0.774 meters, enhancing comfort for extended work sessions. In the Storage Area, a gray metal filing cabinet with dimensions of 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.2 meters is proposed for storing documents and office supplies. Additional recommended objects include a modern metal desk lamp for task lighting, a monitor for computer work, a desk organizer for better organization, and a minimalist gray rug to add warmth without compromising the minimalist style.

## 4. Scene Graph
The desk is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, as it serves as the central element of the workspace. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.8m x 0.75m) fit comfortably against the wall, providing an optimal workspace orientation and aesthetic appeal by facing the entrance. This placement ensures a central focal point in the room, enhancing both functionality and aesthetics. The chair is positioned in front of the desk, facing the south wall, ensuring ergonomic seating directly at the workspace. Its dimensions (0.879m x 0.672m x 0.774m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing the passage or causing spatial conflicts with the desk or the wall.

The filing cabinet is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.4m x 1.2m) ensure it does not obstruct movement in the room, providing easy access to storage without hindering the use of the desk or chair. The lamp is placed on the desk, adjacent to the desk's surface, providing task lighting. Its dimensions (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) allow it to fit comfortably on the desk, ensuring direct lighting on the workspace. The rug is placed in the middle of the room, under the chair and partially under the desk. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.01m) ensure it fits comfortably without overlapping with other objects, providing a cohesive look and comfort underfoot.

The plant is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, enhancing the room's aesthetic without intruding on functional workspace areas. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably without overwhelming the space, maintaining a clear functional zone for work.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the placement of the lamp and monitor on the desk, as the width of the lamp was too small to accommodate the monitor to its left. To resolve this, the monitor was removed based on its lower functional priority compared to the lamp, which provides essential task lighting. This adjustment ensures the room maintains its modern aesthetic and functionality, aligning with the user's preferences for a sleek and organized workspace.
