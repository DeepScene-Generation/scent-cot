## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a bright conservatory featuring rattan furniture, ceramic tiled flooring, and green potted plants. The room is characterized by expansive windows on the south and east walls, allowing natural light to flood the space. The key areas identified include a central seating area, a potted plant arrangement, open walking space, window structures, and ceramic tiled flooring. The user desires a natural aesthetic with functional and decorative elements that enhance the room's airy and light atmosphere.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures based on the user's requirements. The central seating area is designed for comfort and relaxation, featuring a rattan sofa set and a coffee table. The potted plant arrangement is strategically placed along the north and west walls to optimize sunlight exposure and blend harmoniously with the furniture. The open walking space ensures easy movement, contributing to the room's light and airy feel. The window structures are integral to maintaining the light atmosphere, while the ceramic tiled flooring provides durability and aesthetic appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central seating area, a rattan sofa and a coffee table are recommended to provide comfort and a cohesive natural design. The sofa is beige, measuring 2.0 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.7 meters, while the coffee table is brown, measuring 1.2 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.45 meters. Various green potted plants in decorative pots are suggested for the potted plant arrangement, enhancing the room's natural aesthetic. Additional objects such as decorative cushions, a floor lamp, a side table, and a decorative rug are recommended to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetics, ensuring a harmonious blend of natural elements and furniture.

## 4. Scene Graph
The rattan sofa is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to ensure it does not obstruct the central area, which remains open for movement or additional furniture. This placement aligns with the user's input for a conservatory feel and ensures balance and proportion in the room. The coffee table is centrally located in front of the sofa, maintaining a balanced layout and allowing easy access from the sofa. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.45m) fit comfortably without overlapping other objects, contributing to the room's natural aesthetic.

The first potted plant is placed near the east wall, facing the west wall, to balance the room's design and ensure ample light exposure. This placement complements the existing furniture arrangement without causing spatial conflicts. The second potted plant is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, creating visual balance and avoiding overcrowding. Its small size (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.8m) fits comfortably without causing spatial conflicts.

A light green fabric cushion is placed on the sofa, enhancing comfort and style. Its size (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.15m) is suitable for the sofa's seating area, and it adds a splash of color that complements the overall scheme. The floor lamp is placed to the left of the sofa on the south wall, facing the north wall, providing lighting for the seating area and maintaining balance within the room. The side table is placed to the right of the sofa, facing the north wall, ensuring easy access and complementing the floor lamp's position on the opposite side.

The rug is placed under the coffee table and in front of the sofa, with its orientation aligning lengthwise with the sofa. Its size (2.5m x 1.5m) accommodates these pieces without overlapping other objects, tying together the central seating arrangement and enhancing the room's natural style.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The arrangement of objects ensures a balanced and aesthetically pleasing layout that aligns with the user's vision for a bright conservatory. The placement of each object was carefully considered to avoid spatial conflicts and maintain the room's open and airy feel.
