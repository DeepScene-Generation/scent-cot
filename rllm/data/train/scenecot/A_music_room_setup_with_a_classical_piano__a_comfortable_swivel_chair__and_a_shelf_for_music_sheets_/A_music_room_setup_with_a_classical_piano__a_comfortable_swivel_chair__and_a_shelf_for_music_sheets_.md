## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a music room that features a classical piano, a swivel chair, and a music sheet shelf. The room measures 5 meters by 5 meters with a height of 3 meters, providing ample space for sound resonance and movement. The primary focus is on creating a harmonious environment that balances functionality with aesthetic appeal. The user desires a setup that allows for optimal sound travel and ambiance, with a preference for classical and modern elements. The room should remain uncluttered, with 8 to 10 objects fulfilling both functional and aesthetic needs.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main substructures based on the user's requirements. The Piano Area, located against the south wall, serves as the focal point, requiring optimal sound travel and ambiance. The Music Sheet Area on the west wall is designed for storage and easy access to music sheets. The Relaxation Zone in the center of the room features a swivel chair, allowing for relaxation and contemplation. Additional elements like a rug for warmth and sound absorption and an art piece for visual interest are considered to ensure the room's aesthetic and functional balance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Piano Area, a classical piano with dimensions of 1.5 meters by 0.7 meters by 1.2 meters is recommended, accompanied by a matching piano bench measuring 0.6 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.5 meters. A modern wall-mounted light fixture is suggested to enhance the ambiance. In the Music Sheet Area, a modern shelf (1.0 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.8 meters) and a reading lamp are proposed to enhance functionality. The Relaxation Zone features a comfortable swivel chair (0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 1.0 meters) and a small side table (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters) for convenience. A minimalist rug (2.0 meters by 2.0 meters) is recommended for sound absorption, and a modern art piece (0.95 meters by 0.02 meters by 1.4 meters) is suggested for aesthetic enhancement.

## 4. Scene Graph
The classical piano is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, as it is the central element of the music room. This placement allows for optimal sound distribution and accessibility, adhering to both design principles and user input. The piano's dimensions (1.5m x 0.7m x 1.2m) fit well against the wall, leaving ample space for additional objects without overcrowding the room. The piano bench is positioned directly in front of the piano, facing the north wall, ensuring functional use and aesthetic alignment with the music area. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.3m x 0.5m) allow it to fit comfortably without occupying much space.

The wall light is mounted on the south wall above the piano, providing ambient lighting to enhance the music room's atmosphere. Its modern style and brushed nickel color add a contemporary touch to the classical setup. The music shelf is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall, ensuring easy access to music sheets while playing the piano. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.3m x 1.8m) fit comfortably against the wall, maintaining balance and functionality. The reading lamp is positioned adjacent to the music shelf on the west wall, providing focused lighting for reading music sheets without obstructing movement.

The swivel chair is placed to the right of the piano along the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement ensures easy transitioning between playing the piano and accessing the music sheets, providing a functional and aesthetically pleasing setup. The side table is positioned on the east wall, left of the swivel chair, facing the west wall. It is adjacent to the chair, creating a functional and cohesive relaxation area. The rug is placed in the middle of the room, serving as a sound absorption and relaxation zone. It complements the classical and modern styles of the existing furniture, enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal. The art piece is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall, providing an appealing visual focus and complementing the existing decor.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The layout ensures that all objects are positioned without spatial conflicts, maintaining the room's functionality and aesthetic balance. Each object is placed to enhance the room's intended purpose as a music room, adhering to user preferences and design principles.

            - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.15, y: 1.775, z: 0.75

For art_piece_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No rotation difference applicable
        - conclusion: No directional constraint applied
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'north_wall' relation
        - calculation:
            - art_piece_1 size: 0.95x0.02x1.4
            - Cluster size (north_wall): 0.0 (non-directional)
        - conclusion: No directional constraint applied
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'north_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - x_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 0.95/2 = 0.475
            - x_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 0.95/2 = 4.525
            - y_min = y_max = 4.99
            - z_min = 0.7
            - z_max = 2.3
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.475, 4.525, 4.99, 4.99, 0.7, 2.3)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.475-4.525), y(4.99-4.99)
            - Final coordinates: x=0.604, y=4.99, z=1.761
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.604, y: 4.99, z: 1.761
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No other objects in the vicinity
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=0.604, y=4.99, z=1.761
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.604, y: 4.99, z: 1.761
