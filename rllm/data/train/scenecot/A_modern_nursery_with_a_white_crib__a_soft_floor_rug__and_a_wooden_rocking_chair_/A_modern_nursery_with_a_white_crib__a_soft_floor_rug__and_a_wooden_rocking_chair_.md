## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a modern nursery that incorporates a white crib, a soft floor rug, and a wooden rocking chair. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design should focus on creating a safe and serene environment for the baby, with specific areas for sleeping, nursing, and play. The user emphasizes a modern aesthetic, with functional elements such as a dresser for storage, a changing table for convenience, and wall decorations to enhance the room's soothing atmosphere. The overall design should ensure easy movement and interaction within the space, with a total object count not exceeding 15.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The nursery is divided into several key substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Crib Area is positioned against the south wall, serving as the primary sleeping space. The Rocking Chair Area is located near the west wall, providing a comfortable spot for nursing or reading. The Play Rug Area is centrally located, offering an open space for the baby's playtime. Additional areas include the Storage Area on the east wall for the dresser and changing table, and the Decorative Area on the north wall for wall art, enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Crib Area, a modern white crib measuring 1.4 meters by 0.8 meters by 1.0 meter is recommended. The Rocking Chair Area features a modern wooden rocking chair (0.9 meters by 0.7 meters by 1.0 meter) and a side table (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.6 meters) for added functionality. The Play Rug Area includes a soft beige rug (2.0 meters by 2.0 meters) with a soft toy and a baby gym for play and exploration. The Storage Area comprises a modern white dresser (1.0 meter by 0.5 meter by 1.0 meter) and a changing table (1.0 meter by 0.5 meter by 1.0 meter) for convenience. Finally, the Decorative Area features soft pastel wall art to complement the modern nursery theme.

## 4. Scene Graph
The crib is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, as it is the focal point of the nursery. Its dimensions (1.4m x 0.8m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing pathways, ensuring safety and accessibility. The crib's central alignment with the south wall maintains balance and symmetry, adhering to modern design principles.

The mobile, a visual stimulation device, is suspended from the ceiling above the crib. Its placement ensures it does not interfere with the crib's position while providing visual interest for the baby. The mobile's modern style and multi-color design align with the user's preference for a modern nursery.

The rocking chair is placed on the west wall, facing east, adjacent to the crib. Its dimensions (0.9m x 0.7m x 1.0m) ensure no spatial conflict with the crib, maintaining an open space in the center of the room. The chair's placement allows for convenient interaction with the child, enhancing the room's functionality and modern aesthetic.

The side table is positioned on the west wall, to the right of the rocking chair, facing east. This placement ensures it does not obstruct the chair's rocking motion while providing a convenient surface for nursery essentials. The side table's modern design complements the room's aesthetic.

The rug is placed in the middle of the room, providing a soft play area. Its dimensions (2.0m x 2.0m) allow it to fit comfortably without overlapping other furniture. This placement aligns with the user's preference for a soft play area, maintaining balance and openness in the room.

The soft toy is placed on the rug, in the middle of the room, facing upward. This placement ensures safety and accessibility for play, enhancing the room's functionality as a nursery.

The baby gym is positioned on the rug, ensuring it is accessible for play and exploration. Its placement on the soft rug provides a safe and inviting play area, complementing the modern aesthetic of the nursery.

The dresser is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.5m x 1.0m) ensure it does not obstruct movement or access to other functional areas. The dresser's placement provides ample storage while maintaining the room's modern aesthetic.

The changing table is placed on the east wall, next to the dresser, facing the west wall. This arrangement ensures convenient access for diaper changes, respecting the room's spatial limitations and maintaining a modern nursery design.

The wall art is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. Its placement enhances the visual interest of the room without conflicting with existing furniture, complementing the modern nursery theme.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed in a manner that respects the room's spatial limitations and adheres to the user's preferences for a modern nursery. The arrangement ensures functionality, safety, and aesthetic appeal, with no need for repositioning or deletion of objects.
