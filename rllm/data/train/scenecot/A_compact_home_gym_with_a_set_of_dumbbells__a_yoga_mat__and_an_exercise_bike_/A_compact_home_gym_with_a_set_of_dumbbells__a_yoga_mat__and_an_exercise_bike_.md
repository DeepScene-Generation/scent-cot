## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a compact home gym within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary focus is on incorporating essential gym equipment such as dumbbells, a yoga mat, and an exercise bike. The user's requirements emphasize the need for a space that supports strength training, cardiovascular exercise, and floor exercises, while also ensuring safe storage and a flexible layout. Additionally, the user seeks to enhance the gym's functionality and aesthetics with motivational elements and a modern design.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to accommodate the user's requirements. The Strength Training Area is designated for dumbbells and a storage rack, ensuring organization and safety. The Cardio Area is allocated for the exercise bike, providing space for cardiovascular workouts. The Yoga and Stretching Area is centered around a yoga mat and a full-length mirror, facilitating floor exercises and form monitoring. A rubber mat covers the entire floor to prevent slipping and protect the flooring, while a motivational poster adds an energizing ambiance to the space.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Strength Training Area, a modern-style dumbbell set with dimensions of 0.5 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.4 meters is recommended. The Cardio Area features a modern exercise bike measuring 1.2 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.2 meters. The Yoga and Stretching Area includes a minimalist rubber yoga mat (1.8 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.02 meters) and a modern glass mirror (1.5 meters by 0.05 meters by 2.0 meters). A modern rubber floor mat (1.581 meters by 1.621 meters by 0.0049 meters) is suggested for floor protection. Finally, a motivational poster (0.6 meters by 0.02 meters by 0.9 meters) is recommended to enhance the gym's aesthetic appeal.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dumbbell set is placed on the floor against the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement is strategic for maintaining an open central space, aligning with the user's preference for a compact gym. The dumbbell set's small size allows it to fit comfortably without obstructing other activities, ensuring easy access for strength training.

The exercise bike is positioned on the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement creates a balanced layout by separating the cardio and strength training areas, adhering to the user's input for a compact home gym. The exercise bike's dimensions allow for sufficient space around it, ensuring safety and usability during workouts.

The yoga mat is centrally located in the middle of the room, providing ample space for stretching and exercises. Its placement ensures there are no obstructions, allowing full utilization of the mat's surface area. The mat's alignment parallel to the north or south wall optimizes space usage, maintaining balance and openness in the room layout.

The mirror is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This location provides a clear view for users on the yoga mat, enabling them to monitor their form during exercises. The mirror's modern style and silver color integrate seamlessly with the existing gym setup, contributing to a cohesive aesthetic.

The floor mat is placed in the middle of the room, covering the central floor area. It is positioned under the yoga mat, enhancing comfort and functionality. This placement optimizes floor protection without obstructing the use of existing equipment or altering the room's aesthetics.

The motivational poster is mounted on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures visibility from various parts of the room, including when using the exercise bike and yoga mat. The poster's varied colors add vibrancy to the gym environment, enhancing both aesthetics and functionality.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts were identified due to the limited space on the west wall, which could not accommodate all intended objects, including the dumbbell set, dumbbell rack, and bench. To resolve this, the dumbbell rack and bench were removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a compact home gym with essential equipment like the dumbbell set, yoga mat, and exercise bike. This decision maintains the room's functionality and aligns with the user's requirements for a streamlined and efficient workout space.
