## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a casual den that emphasizes comfort and relaxation, featuring a plush sectional sofa, a large ottoman, and a bookshelf. The sectional is intended to provide ample seating and a welcoming atmosphere, while the ottoman serves as both a footrest and a casual table. The bookshelf is meant to store reading materials, enhancing the room's intellectual appeal. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, and the user desires a layout that maximizes space and functionality while maintaining a cozy and inviting ambiance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Seating Area is centered around the sectional sofa, providing a comfortable space for relaxation. The Ottoman Area is positioned in front of the sectional, serving as a footrest and casual table. The Storage Area is defined by the bookshelf on the east wall, offering a place for books and decorative items. Additional substructures include the Lighting Area, enhanced by a floor lamp, and the Decorative Area, which includes a rug and cushions to add comfort and visual interest.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a casual-style sectional sofa measuring 3.0 meters by 2.0 meters by 0.9 meters is recommended. The Ottoman Area features a large leather ottoman (1.2 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.5 meters) to complement the sectional. The Storage Area includes a modern wooden bookshelf (1.0 meter by 0.4 meter by 2.2 meters) for storing books. A contemporary metal side table (0.5 meter by 0.5 meter by 0.6 meter) is suggested for holding items beside the sectional. A modern metal floor lamp (0.3 meter by 0.3 meter by 1.8 meters) provides additional lighting. A bohemian-style wool rug (2.5 meters by 2.5 meters) and a set of casual fabric cushions (each 0.5 meter by 0.5 meter by 0.2 meter) in blue, green, and orange add comfort and aesthetic appeal.

## 4. Scene Graph
The sectional sofa is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to maximize seating space and maintain an open floor area for additional objects. Its dimensions (3.0m x 2.0m x 0.9m) fit well against the wall, aligning with the casual den concept and providing a central, inviting seating area. The ottoman is positioned directly in front of the sectional, facing the north wall, to serve as a footrest and casual table. Its size (1.2m x 0.8m x 0.5m) allows it to fit comfortably in the available space, enhancing the room's functionality and maintaining a cohesive design.

The bookshelf is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, to provide stability and accessibility for book storage. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.4m x 2.2m) ensure it does not obstruct pathways or views, complementing the sectional sofa on the south wall and maintaining an open and inviting atmosphere. The side table is positioned on the right side of the sectional sofa, facing the north wall, to provide easy access for those seated. Its size (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.6m) fits well beside the sectional, enhancing usability and maintaining a casual, functional setup.

The floor lamp is placed to the left of the sectional sofa, on the south wall, facing the north wall, to provide ambient lighting for the seating area. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.8m) ensure it does not interfere with other objects, maintaining a balanced layout and adhering to user preferences for a casual den. The rug is placed on the floor in the middle of the room, extending from under the sectional sofa to beneath the ottoman. Its size (2.5m x 2.5m) unifies the seating arrangement, adding comfort and visual interest without interfering with other furnishings.

Cushion_1, Cushion_2, and Cushion_3 are placed on the sectional sofa, facing the north wall, to enhance comfort and aesthetic appeal. Each cushion measures 0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m, fitting comfortably on the sofa without causing clutter. The cushions add color contrast and maintain the proportionality on the sofa, supporting the den's casual theme.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The arrangement of objects in the room adheres to the user's preferences and design principles, ensuring a cohesive and functional layout. All objects are positioned to maximize space and maintain an inviting atmosphere, aligning with the vision of a casual den.
