## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a minimalist lounge area with modern furnishings, emphasizing a gray fabric chaise lounge, a white wooden coffee table, and a black metal decorative sculpture. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary focus is on creating a space that balances relaxation and aesthetic appeal, with additional seating and lighting to enhance functionality and comfort. The user prefers a modern style, prioritizing objects that fulfill multiple functions and contribute significantly to the room's design.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional zones based on user requirements. The Chaise Lounge Area serves as the primary relaxation zone, featuring an ergonomic and stylish chaise lounge. The Decorative Sculpture Area is positioned to add artistic flair, serving as a visual centerpiece. The Coffee Table Area provides a functional surface for casual activities like dining or work. Additional seating is considered for enhanced comfort, and a Lighting Area is proposed to improve ambiance and style. A Side Table Area supports casual activities by holding items near the chaise lounge.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Chaise Lounge Area, a modern gray fabric chaise lounge is recommended, measuring 2.0 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.7 meters. The Decorative Sculpture Area features a black metal sculpture, 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.5 meters, to serve as an artistic centerpiece. The Coffee Table Area includes a modern white wooden table, 1.2 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.45 meters, for casual dining or work. A modern white wooden side table, 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters, is suggested for holding items. A gray fabric pouf, 0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters, is recommended for additional seating.

## 4. Scene Graph
The chaise lounge is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to maximize comfort and style. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.8m x 0.7m) fit well against the wall, creating an inviting relaxation space while leaving the room open for other objects. This placement aligns with modern design principles, ensuring balance and proportion.

The coffee table is positioned in front of the chaise lounge, in the middle of the room, to provide functionality for casual dining or work. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.45m) allow it to be accessible from the chaise lounge, enhancing utility and maintaining a cohesive aesthetic with the gray fabric of the chaise lounge.

The sculpture is placed in the corner where the east wall meets the south wall, facing the west wall. This placement ensures visibility and complements the modern aesthetic without obstructing movement. The sculpture's dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.5m) allow it to stand out as a decorative piece without cluttering the space.

The side table is placed on the south wall, left of the chaise lounge, to provide easy access for someone seated on the chaise lounge. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.5m) fit well in the available space, ensuring functionality in holding items and maintaining balance with the armchair.

The pouf is placed on the south side of the coffee table, in front of the chaise lounge, ensuring accessibility and visual harmony with the room's design. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.4m) fit comfortably between the coffee table and chaise lounge, avoiding obstruction and maintaining a cohesive style with the existing furniture.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the placement of the floor lamp, initially intended to be left of the armchair, as the chaise lounge occupied that space. The lamp was repositioned to the right of the armchair, maintaining its functionality and aesthetic alignment with the room's modern style. Additionally, the armchair and floor lamp were removed due to spatial constraints on the south wall, prioritizing the chaise lounge, coffee table, and decorative sculpture based on user preferences and room functionality.
