## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a cozy and inviting living room featuring a spacious L-shaped sofa and a coffee table, with an emphasis on creating a comfortable atmosphere. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design should incorporate natural light from a window on the south wall, complemented by ceiling fixtures. The primary functional needs include ample seating, a centralized activity area around the coffee table, and easy movement throughout the space. The user prefers a modern aesthetic, with additional elements like a rug, TV stand, TV, decorative cushions, a side table, a floor lamp, and a plant to enhance both functionality and aesthetics.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The living room is divided into several key substructures based on user requirements. The L-shaped Sofa Area is designated for seating, positioned against the west wall to maximize space efficiency. The Coffee Table Area serves as the central hub for activities, located in the middle of the room. The Lighting Setup includes both natural light from the south wall and artificial lighting from ceiling fixtures and a floor lamp. The Open Movement Space ensures easy navigation throughout the room. These substructures collectively support the room's functionality and aesthetic goals.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the L-shaped Sofa Area, a modern fabric sofa measuring 3.211 meters by 1.018 meters by 0.784 meters is recommended, providing ample seating without overwhelming the space. The Coffee Table Area features a modern wood and metal coffee table (1.2 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.4 meters) as the central activity hub. A modern wool rug (2.5 meters by 2.5 meters) is suggested to enhance comfort and aesthetics. The Lighting Setup includes a modern metal floor lamp (0.601 meters by 0.601 meters by 1.902 meters) for additional illumination. Decorative elements such as modern fabric cushions, a TV stand, a TV, and a plant are recommended to balance aesthetics and functionality.

## 4. Scene Graph
The L-shaped sofa is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall, to maximize space efficiency and aesthetic appeal. Its dimensions (3.211m x 1.018m x 0.784m) allow it to provide ample seating without overwhelming the room. This placement ensures the sofa faces the open area, creating a welcoming seating arrangement and leaving room for a coffee table in the center. The coffee table, measuring 1.2 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.4 meters, is centrally located in front of the sofa, serving as a hub for activities and maintaining balance and functionality. The rug, with dimensions of 2.5 meters by 2.5 meters, is placed under the coffee table, visually tying the seating area together and enhancing comfort. The TV stand is positioned against the east wall, facing the west wall, allowing for comfortable viewing from the sofa. The TV is placed on the TV stand, maintaining balance and proportion in the room layout. Cushions are placed on the sofa to enhance comfort and add color, with cushion_1 and cushion_2 positioned to maintain a balanced look. The floor lamp is placed to the left of the sofa on the west wall, providing effective lighting for the seating area. The plant is positioned on the south wall, adding a decorative accent without obstructing movement or sightlines.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited length of the west wall, which could not accommodate all intended objects, including the coffee table, plant, TV stand, side table, sofa, and floor lamp. To resolve this, the side table and plant were removed, as they were deemed less critical to the user's preference for a living room centered around a coffee table and a spacious L-shaped sofa. This adjustment ensured that the remaining objects could be placed without spatial conflicts, maintaining the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.
