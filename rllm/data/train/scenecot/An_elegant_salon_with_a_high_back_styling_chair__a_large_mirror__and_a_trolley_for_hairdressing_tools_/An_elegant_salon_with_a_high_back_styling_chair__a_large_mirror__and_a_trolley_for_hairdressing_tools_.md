## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions an elegant salon that prioritizes sophistication, functionality, and client comfort. Essential elements include a high-back styling chair, a large mirror, and a trolley for hairdressing tools. The salon's design should enhance both functionality and aesthetic appeal, with a focus on creating a sophisticated atmosphere. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for the desired layout.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The salon is divided into several functional substructures based on user requirements. The central area is designated for the styling chair, ensuring it serves as the focal point for client interaction. The north wall is reserved for the mirror, providing a reflective surface for styling activities. The middle of the room accommodates the tool trolley, ensuring easy access to styling tools. The ceiling is utilized for lighting, ensuring even illumination throughout the space. Additionally, the corner between the south and east walls is designated for decorative elements like a plant, enhancing the salon's ambiance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central area, an elegant leather high-back styling chair is recommended, providing both comfort and a focal point. The north wall features a large, elegant mirror to enhance visibility and the perception of space. A modern metal tool trolley is suggested for the middle of the room, offering practical storage for hairdressing tools. A modern chrome ceiling light fixture is recommended for the ceiling to ensure optimal lighting. Finally, a tall, slim plant in a ceramic pot is proposed for the corner between the south and east walls, adding a touch of nature and elegance to the salon.

## 4. Scene Graph
The styling chair, a key element in the salon, is placed in the middle of the room facing the north wall. Its elegant leather design makes it a focal point, allowing easy access from all sides for the stylist. The chair's dimensions are 0.627 meters in length, 0.603 meters in width, and 0.778 meters in height. This central placement avoids crowding near walls, making the room feel spacious and adhering to design principles of balance and functionality.

The mirror, essential for styling purposes, is placed on the north wall, directly facing the styling chair. This placement ensures optimal functionality, providing a clear view for clients and stylists. The mirror's dimensions are 0.694 meters in length, 0.089 meters in width, and 1.544 meters in height. Its elegant style complements the styling chair, creating a cohesive aesthetic while maintaining balance and proportion within the room.

The tool trolley, a functional piece for storing hairdressing tools, is placed to the right of the styling chair in the middle of the room. This position ensures ease of access for the hairdresser while maintaining the room's elegant and functional theme. The trolley's dimensions are 0.6 meters in length, 0.4 meters in width, and 0.9 meters in height. Its modern design complements the elegant theme, providing necessary functionality without disrupting the room's balance or aesthetics.

The ceiling light is centrally placed on the ceiling, ensuring balanced illumination for the entire room. Its dimensions are 0.161 meters in length, 0.161 meters in width, and 0.776 meters in height. This placement avoids any spatial conflicts with existing objects, as it does not occupy floor space, and enhances the room's functionality and aesthetics by providing essential overhead lighting.

The plant is placed in the corner between the south and east walls, facing the west wall. Its dimensions are 0.898 meters in length, 0.92 meters in width, and 1.311 meters in height. This location adds decorative appeal, maintains functionality, and aligns with the elegant theme. The plant's ceramic pot and green foliage provide a pleasing contrast to the salon's existing materials and colors, enhancing the room's decor without obstructing salon operations.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified regarding the placement of the side table, which was intended to be placed left of the styling chair. The width of the styling chair was too small to accommodate the side table in this position. To resolve this conflict, the side table was removed from the layout, as it was deemed less critical compared to the other essential elements like the styling chair, mirror, and tool trolley. This decision aligns with the user's preference for an elegant salon with a focus on functionality and client comfort.
