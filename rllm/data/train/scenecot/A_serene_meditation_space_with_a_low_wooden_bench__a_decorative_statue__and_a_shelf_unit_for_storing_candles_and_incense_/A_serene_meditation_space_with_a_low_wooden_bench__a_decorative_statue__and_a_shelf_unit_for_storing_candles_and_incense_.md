## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a serene meditation space that emphasizes a calming and uncluttered atmosphere. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a low wooden bench for meditation, a decorative statue as a focal point, and a shelf unit for storing candles and incense. The user desires a minimalistic design with natural elements to enhance the meditative ambiance, ensuring that the room remains functional and aesthetically pleasing.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to support the meditation theme. The Meditation Bench Area is central, providing seating for meditation. The Decorative Statue Area serves as a visual focal point, enhancing the room's serene theme. The Storage Area, located along the east wall, is designated for storing candles and incense, contributing to the calming atmosphere. An Open Pathway ensures easy movement and accessibility, while additional elements like a Floor Cushion and a Small Table offer seating flexibility and support for decorative items.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Meditation Bench Area, a minimalist wooden bench measuring 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.4 meters is recommended. The Decorative Statue Area features a zen-style stone statue with dimensions of 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.6 meters. The Storage Area includes a modern wooden shelf unit measuring 1.0 meter by 0.3 meters by 1.8 meters. A minimalist fabric floor cushion (0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.15 meters) and a small wooden table (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.4 meters) are suggested for additional seating and item placement. A plant in a ceramic pot (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter) enhances the natural ambiance, while modern wax candles (0.065 meters by 0.065 meters by 0.058 meters) provide lighting and ambiance.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden bench is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to serve as the primary seating for meditation. Its minimalist style and natural wood color align with the serene theme, and its dimensions (1.5m x 0.5m x 0.4m) allow it to fit comfortably, leaving ample space for movement. This placement ensures a direct view towards the north wall, enhancing the meditative experience by minimizing distractions.

The decorative statue is positioned on the west wall, facing east. This placement allows it to be a focal point visible from the bench, reinforcing the room's serene ambiance. The statue's zen style and stone material complement the natural theme, and its size (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) ensures it does not obstruct pathways or the meditation space.

The shelf unit is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This location provides easy access for storing candles and incense, essential for the calming atmosphere. The shelf's modern style and dark wood color balance the room's layout, and its dimensions (1.0m x 0.3m x 1.8m) fit well against the wall without overwhelming the space.

The floor cushion is placed in front of the wooden bench, facing the north wall. Its minimalist design and beige color complement the bench, providing additional seating without obstructing movement. The cushion's size (0.8m x 0.8m x 0.15m) allows it to fit comfortably, maintaining the room's open and serene atmosphere.

The plant is positioned on the east wall, near the shelf unit, facing the west wall. This placement enhances the room's natural ambiance, maintaining balance and symmetry. The plant's height (1.0m) ensures it is noticeable but not overwhelming, contributing to the room's aesthetic without obstructing the flow.

The candles are placed on the shelf unit, located on the east wall, facing the west wall. Their small size (0.065m x 0.065m x 0.058m) ensures they do not interfere with other objects, and their modern style complements the shelf unit, enhancing the room's ambiance.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts were identified with the incense holder and the small table. The width of the candles was too small to accommodate the incense holder, and the decorative statue's width was insufficient for the small table. To resolve these conflicts, the incense holder and the small table were removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a serene meditation space with a low wooden bench, a decorative statue, and a shelf unit for storing candles and incense. This resolution ensures the room remains functional and aesthetically aligned with the user's vision.
