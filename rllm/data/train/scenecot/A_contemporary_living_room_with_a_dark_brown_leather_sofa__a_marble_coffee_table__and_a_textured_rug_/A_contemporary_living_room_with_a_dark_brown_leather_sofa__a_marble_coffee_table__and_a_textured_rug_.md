## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a contemporary living room characterized by a dark brown leather sofa, a marble coffee table, and a textured rug. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design aims to create a modern and elegant atmosphere, emphasizing contrast between smooth and textured surfaces while maintaining a cohesive color scheme. The room should provide ergonomic comfort with adequate seating and spacing for movement, ensuring the durability of materials. Additional elements such as a side table, floor lamp, media console, decorative cushions, a plant, and wall-mounted art are recommended to enhance the room's modern elegance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on user requirements. The Seating Area features the leather sofa, providing ergonomic comfort and aligning with the modern design. The Central Area is designated for the marble coffee table, serving as a focal point for decor display and maintaining contrast with other textures. The Rug Area enhances warmth and comfort, tying the seating arrangement together. Additional substructures include the Decorative Area for cushions and wall art, and the Lighting and Media Areas for the floor lamp and media console, respectively.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a contemporary dark brown leather sofa measuring 2.0 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.85 meters is recommended. The Central Area features a marble coffee table with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters. A textured rug measuring 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters is suggested for the Rug Area. Decorative cushions in various colors are proposed to enhance the sofa's aesthetic. A floor lamp and media console are recommended for the Lighting and Media Areas, respectively, while a plant and wall art add aesthetic appeal to the Decorative Area.

## 4. Scene Graph
The leather sofa is a central piece in the living room, crucial for both functionality and aesthetics. It is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to save space and ensure ease of movement. This placement provides a balanced view towards the center of the room, where other elements like the coffee table can be positioned. The sofa's dimensions are 2.0 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.85 meters, and it is oriented to face the north wall, adhering to design principles of balance and proportion.

The marble coffee table is placed directly in front of the leather sofa, centrally aligned in the middle of the room. Its dimensions are 1.2 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters, allowing it to fit comfortably without obstructing movement. This placement ensures functionality and aesthetic harmony, serving as a surface for drinks and decor while enhancing the room's contemporary style.

The textured rug is positioned on the floor, in front of the leather sofa, and under the coffee table. Measuring 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters, it fits comfortably in the available space, providing comfort and warmth. The rug enhances the aesthetic appeal by creating a cohesive seating area, adhering to the room's contemporary style.

A decorative cushion is placed on the leather sofa, enhancing the seating area's comfort and style. The cushion's contemporary style and various colors complement the dark brown leather of the sofa, adding visual interest. It is positioned centrally on the sofa, ensuring it does not obstruct seating functionality.

The wall art is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions are 1.2 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.8 meters, allowing it to fit comfortably without overwhelming the space. This placement creates a visual focal point for people seated on the sofa, enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal and serving its decorative function effectively.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts were identified due to limited space on the leather sofa and the south wall. The sofa could not accommodate both decorative cushions, leading to the removal of one cushion (decorative_cushion_2) to maintain functionality and user preference for a contemporary living room. Additionally, the south wall was too small to accommodate all intended objects, resulting in the removal of the floor lamp, side table, plant, and media console. These adjustments ensure the room remains functional and aesthetically pleasing, adhering to the user's vision of a modern and elegant living space.
