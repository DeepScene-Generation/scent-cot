## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a spacious walk-in closet with specific features, including an island dresser, open shelving for shoes, and a full-length mirror. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters. The user's preferences emphasize organization, luxury, safety, and efficient space usage. The design should incorporate modern aesthetics while ensuring functionality and accessibility.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Shoe Shelving Area is designated along the south wall for easy access and visibility. The Central Area is reserved for the island dresser, serving as the focal point for clothing layout. The North Wall is allocated for the full-length mirror, providing a space for outfit checks. Additional areas include the West Wall for a drawer unit to enhance storage, and the Ceiling for lighting fixtures to ensure adequate illumination. The Middle Area also accommodates a rug for comfort and a stool for seating at the island dresser.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Shoe Shelving Area, modern open shelves made of wood and measuring 4.0 meters by 0.3 meters by 2.5 meters are recommended. The Central Area features a modern gray island dresser (1.357 meters by 0.842 meters by 0.873 meters) and a contemporary wool rug (2.0 meters by 1.5 meters) for comfort. A full-length mirror (0.8 meters by 0.05 meters by 2.0 meters) is proposed for the North Wall. A modern metal stool (0.386 meters by 0.43 meters by 0.807 meters) complements the island dresser. The West Wall accommodates a modern white drawer unit (1.0 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.2 meters) for additional storage. A chrome metal lighting fixture (0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.2 meters) is recommended for the Ceiling. Finally, a gold metal accessory tray (0.4 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.05 meters) is suggested for the island dresser.

## 4. Scene Graph
The shoe shelving is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to maximize accessibility and maintain an organized layout. Its dimensions (4.0m x 0.3m x 2.5m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing the central area, aligning with the user's preference for open shelving.

The island dresser is centrally located in the room, ensuring accessibility from all sides. Its dimensions (1.357m x 0.842m x 0.873m) are suitable for the middle of the room, providing balance and functionality without obstructing movement or access to other objects.

The full-length mirror is centrally placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.05m x 2.0m) fit well within the available space, providing optimal functionality for outfit checks and enhancing the room's aesthetic.

The stool is positioned to the west of the island dresser, facing east. Its placement ensures no conflict with other objects, maintaining the room's spacious design and providing seating functionality.

The lighting fixture is centrally placed on the ceiling, facing downward. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.2m) ensure it does not create spatial conflicts, providing even illumination across the room and complementing the modern style.

The rug is placed under the island dresser, emphasizing the central feature of the room. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m) allow for some overhang, enhancing comfort and aesthetic appeal without obstructing pathways.

The drawer unit is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.5m x 1.2m) fit comfortably, providing additional storage without obstructing the island dresser or other objects.

The accessory tray is placed on the island dresser, facing the north wall. Its small size (0.4m x 0.3m x 0.05m) ensures it does not overwhelm the dresser's surface, providing organized storage for accessories.

## 5. Global Check
There are no conflicts detected in the layout, as all objects are placed in a manner that maximizes space efficiency and adheres to the user's preferences for a spacious and organized walk-in closet. The placement of each object aligns with design principles, ensuring balance, functionality, and aesthetic appeal throughout the room.
