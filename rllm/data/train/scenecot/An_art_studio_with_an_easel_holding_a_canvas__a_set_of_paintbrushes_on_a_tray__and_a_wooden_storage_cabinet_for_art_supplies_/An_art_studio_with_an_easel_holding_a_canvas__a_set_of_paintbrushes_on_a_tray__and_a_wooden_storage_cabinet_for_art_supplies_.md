## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions an art studio designed to foster creativity and ease of access to tools, with specific elements such as an easel with a canvas, a set of paintbrushes on a tray, and a wooden storage cabinet for art supplies. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, is intended to be open and inspiring, promoting creativity. The user desires ample wall space for displaying artworks, suggesting a layout that efficiently organizes the room while enhancing its aesthetic appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The art studio is divided into several key substructures based on user requirements. The central painting area is the primary workspace, requiring an easel and canvas to support painting activities, with an emphasis on good lighting and spaciousness. The storage area is designated for organizing art supplies, necessitating a robust wooden storage cabinet. Display wall spaces are crucial for showcasing finished artworks, turning the walls into galleries that enhance the studio's aesthetic appeal. Additionally, the paintbrush tray area should be accessible and organized, ensuring tools are within easy reach to support the creative process.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central painting area, a traditional wooden easel with dimensions of 0.8 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.8 meters is recommended to hold the canvas. The canvas itself, measuring 0.7 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.9 meters, is designed to fit on the easel. A minimalist metal paintbrush tray, sized at 0.287 meters by 0.229 meters by 0.016 meters, is suggested for organizing paintbrushes. The storage area features a rustic wooden storage cabinet with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.8 meters to store various art materials. For displaying artworks, contemporary canvas displays, each measuring 2.0 meters by 0.1 meters by 1.5 meters, are recommended to be placed on the walls.

## 4. Scene Graph
The easel, a central piece in the art studio, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures it receives consistent light throughout the day, providing ample space for the artist to work comfortably. The easel's dimensions (0.8m x 0.6m x 1.8m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall without crowding the space, adhering to the user's desire for an art studio layout that promotes creativity and easy access to tools.

The canvas is positioned on the easel, facing the south wall, aligning with the orientation of the easel. This placement is consistent with its use as a painting surface, maintaining a coherent aesthetic with the existing easel and ensuring functionality for painting activities.

The paintbrush tray is placed on the floor, right of the easel, facing the north wall. This placement ensures easy access to the paintbrushes while painting, maintaining the studio's functional and aesthetic harmony. The tray's small size ensures it won't obstruct any existing objects or paths, aligning with the user's preference for an art studio setup.

The storage cabinet is placed on the north wall, left of the easel, facing the south wall. This placement provides easy access while painting and maintains balance in the room layout. The cabinet's dimensions (1.2m x 0.5m x 1.8m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, complementing the rustic theme and ensuring the studio remains tidy.

The first artwork display is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, ensuring visibility and avoiding interference with the easel and storage cabinet. This placement complements the studio's functionality and aesthetic by providing a dedicated space for displaying artwork.

The second artwork display is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. This location ensures the display is a prominent feature within the studio, complementing the first artwork display on the opposite wall. The placement provides an open central area for artistic activities and maintains a visually balanced room.

The third artwork display is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, ensuring it is well-positioned for visibility and accessibility without interfering with the other elements in the room. This placement maintains a cohesive and balanced design throughout the art studio.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified regarding the length of the north wall, which was too small to accommodate all intended objects, including the storage cabinet, artwork display, paintbrush tray, and easel. To resolve this, the artwork display intended for the north wall was removed, as it was deemed less critical compared to the functional needs of the easel, paintbrush tray, and storage cabinet. This decision aligns with the user's preference for an art studio with essential tools and storage, ensuring the room remains functional and aesthetically pleasing.
