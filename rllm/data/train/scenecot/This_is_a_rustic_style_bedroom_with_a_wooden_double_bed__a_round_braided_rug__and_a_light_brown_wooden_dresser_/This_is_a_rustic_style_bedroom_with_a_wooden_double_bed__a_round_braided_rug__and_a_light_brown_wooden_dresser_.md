## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a rustic-style bedroom that emphasizes natural materials and warm, inviting colors. The primary furniture pieces include a wooden double bed, a braided rug, and a wooden dresser, all contributing to a cohesive rustic aesthetic. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user prioritizes functionality and aesthetic harmony, seeking additional items like a bedside table, lamp, seating area, and wall decorations to enhance the room's usability and visual appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures: the Sleeping Area, which includes the wooden double bed and bedside table; the Storage Area, featuring the wooden dresser; the Floor Covering Area, highlighted by the braided rug; and the Decorative Area, which includes wall art and a wall shelf. These substructures align with the rustic theme and provide essential functions such as rest, storage, and aesthetic enhancement.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sleeping Area, a rustic wooden double bed (2.0m x 1.8m x 1.2m) and a bedside table (0.5m x 0.4m x 0.6m) are recommended, complemented by a rustic lamp (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.4m) for ambient lighting. The Storage Area features a light brown wooden dresser (1.2m x 0.5m x 1.0m) for storing personal items. The Floor Covering Area includes a braided rug (1.5m x 1.5m x 0.01m) to enhance the room's warmth. The Decorative Area is adorned with a rustic wall shelf (1.0m x 0.2m x 0.2m) and wall art (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.8m) to add visual interest and maintain the rustic theme.

## 4. Scene Graph
The bed, a central piece in the rustic-style bedroom, is placed centrally against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement optimizes space usage, provides a natural focal point, and allows easy access from both sides, adhering to the user's rustic style preference and maintaining balance and functionality. The braided rug is positioned in the middle of the room, complementing the bed and creating visual balance without spatial conflicts. Its earthy tones align with the rustic style, enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal.

The dresser is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall, providing balance by distributing furniture along opposite walls. This placement avoids conflicts with the centrally located rug and ensures easy access for storage. The bedside table is placed to the left of the bed, maintaining functionality and aesthetic harmony. The rustic lamp is placed on the bedside table, providing convenient lighting and complementing the rustic theme.

The wall shelf is installed on the west wall above the dresser, ensuring visibility and functionality without occupying floor space. This placement creates a balanced composition along the west wall, enhancing the room's rustic decor. The wall art is placed on the south wall, providing a decorative element that complements the rustic style and enhances the room's aesthetic appeal without obstructing pathways or conflicting with other objects.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited space on the north wall, which could not accommodate all intended objects, including the bed, bedside table, chair, and side table. To resolve this, the side table and chair were removed, prioritizing the bed and bedside table for their higher functional importance in the rustic-style bedroom. This adjustment ensures the room remains functional and aesthetically pleasing, adhering to the user's preferences.
