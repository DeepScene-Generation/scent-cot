## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a professional office space that emphasizes functionality and comfort, with a minimalist design. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a large wooden desk, an ergonomic swivel chair, and a high-resolution computer monitor. The user prioritizes clean lines and open space for movement, reflecting a preference for a modern aesthetic that supports work activities efficiently.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main areas: the Desk Area, the Seating Area, and the Open Area. The Desk Area is dedicated to computer work, featuring the desk and monitor as essential components. The Seating Area focuses on ergonomic support, ensuring comfort during extended work periods with the inclusion of a swivel chair. The Open Area is designed for movement and document handling, maintaining the room's minimalist and professional appearance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Desk Area, a modern wooden desk and a high-resolution monitor are recommended, essential for the user's work tasks. The Seating Area includes an ergonomic swivel chair to ensure comfort. Additional items such as a desk lamp for focused lighting, a filing cabinet for document storage, and a small plant for aesthetic enhancement are suggested. A rug is recommended for the Open Area to define the space and contribute to the room's visual coherence.

## 4. Scene Graph
The large wooden desk is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to maintain a professional and functional setup. Its dimensions are 2.0 meters in length, 1.0 meter in width, and 0.75 meters in height. This placement allows for easy access and interaction, aligning with the user's vision of a professional office space. The monitor, measuring 0.6 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.4 meters, is centrally positioned on the desk, facing the north wall, ensuring ergonomic use and avoiding neck strain.

The ergonomic swivel chair, with dimensions of 0.7 meters by 0.7 meters by 1.2 meters, is placed in front of the desk, facing the south wall. This placement ensures optimal functionality and accessibility, allowing for easy movement and interaction with the desk and monitor. The desk lamp, with a footprint of 0.2 meters by 0.2 meters and a height of 0.5 meters, is placed on the desk to the right of the monitor, providing effective lighting without obstructing the view.

The filing cabinet, measuring 0.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.75 meters, is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall. This location ensures accessibility and maintains the room's balance, contributing to the overall functionality of the office space. The plant, in a ceramic pot with dimensions of 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.8 meters, is placed on the west wall to the left of the filing cabinet, enhancing the room's ambiance without causing spatial conflicts.

The rug, measuring 2.5 meters by 2.5 meters, is placed in the middle of the room under both the desk and chair, facing the north wall. This placement defines the workspace effectively, complementing the existing decor and providing comfort underfoot.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were positioned to ensure functionality and aesthetic appeal, adhering to the user's preferences for a professional and minimalist office space.
