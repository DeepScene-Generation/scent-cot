## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a sleek hair salon with a monochrome theme, emphasizing modern aesthetics and functionality. Essential elements include a barber chair, a mirror, and a styling station. The salon must maintain a modern and chic ambiance while ensuring ergonomic design for client comfort and stylist efficiency. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user prioritizes a sleek design with a white and black barber chair, a silver-framed mirror, and a black styling station, avoiding any objects related to doors or windows.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The salon is divided into key areas based on user requirements. The Barber Chair Area is central, providing a focal point for client seating. The Styling Station Area is positioned for easy access to tools and products, supporting stylist efficiency. Open Floor Space is maintained for ease of movement, ensuring the salon remains uncluttered. The Lighting Setup is crucial for clear visibility, enhancing both functionality and ambiance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Barber Chair Area, a modern barber chair with ergonomic features and a white and black color scheme is recommended. The Styling Station Area features a modern black styling station with ample storage for tools, aligning with the monochrome theme. A large silver-framed mirror is suggested to enhance the salon's spaciousness and aesthetics. Modern lighting fixtures are recommended to provide balanced illumination. Additional items include a hairdryer, a set of scissors, a trolley for tool access, and a stylist chair, although the latter was removed due to spatial constraints.

## 4. Scene Graph
The barber chair is placed near the middle of the room, facing the north wall. This central placement ensures it is accessible for client use and aligns with the user's modern style preference. The chair's dimensions are 0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 1.2 meters, and it is oriented to face the north wall, ensuring clients have a clear view of the mirror and styling station.

The mirror is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures it serves its functional purpose while maintaining the salon's sleek and modern aesthetic. The mirror's dimensions are 1.2 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.8 meters, and it complements the barber chair's placement by providing a focal point and enhancing the room's spaciousness.

The styling station is positioned against the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions are 1.0 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.9 meters. This placement supports functionality by allowing easy access to tools and products, while its black color aligns with the monochrome theme. The station is placed to the right of the barber chair, maintaining balance and symmetry in the room.

The lighting fixture is centrally placed on the ceiling, providing even illumination throughout the room. Its dimensions are 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.3 meters. This placement ensures the room is well-lit, enhancing both functionality and the modern aesthetic.

The hairdryer is placed on the styling station, ensuring it is easily accessible for styling purposes. Its dimensions are 0.3 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.2 meters. This placement maintains the sleek and modern look of the salon by keeping tools organized and within reach.

The scissors are also placed on the styling station, ensuring easy access during hair cutting tasks. Their dimensions are 0.2 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.02 meters. This placement supports functionality and maintains the organized aesthetic of the salon.

The trolley is placed on the east wall, right of the styling station, facing the west wall. Its dimensions are 0.5 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.9 meters. This placement ensures accessibility and maintains the overall sleek design of the salon.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the placement of the stylist chair, as the width of the styling station was too small to accommodate it to the left. To resolve this, the stylist chair was removed, as it was deemed less important for the user's preference and the room's functionality. This decision maintained the sleek and modern aesthetic while ensuring the room remained functional and uncluttered.
