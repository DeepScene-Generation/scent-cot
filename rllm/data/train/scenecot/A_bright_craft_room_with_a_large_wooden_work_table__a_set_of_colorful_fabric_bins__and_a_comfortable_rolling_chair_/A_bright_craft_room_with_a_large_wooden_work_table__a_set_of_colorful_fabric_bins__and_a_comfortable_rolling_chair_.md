## 1. Requirement Analysis
The craft room is designed to support an artist's creative process, emphasizing both functionality and aesthetics. The user envisions a space that includes a large wooden work table, colorful fabric bins, and a comfortable rolling chair. The room should be bright and inviting, with natural lighting and pastel-colored walls enhancing the atmosphere. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user prioritizes a central workspace, efficient storage solutions, and ergonomic seating, with additional enhancements like ceiling-mounted lighting and a multifunctional side table to support various crafting activities.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The scene is divided into several key substructures based on user requirements. The Central Workspace Area is the focal point, centered around the large wooden work table for crafting activities. The Storage Area is designated for organizing craft supplies using colorful fabric bins. The Seating Area includes a comfortable rolling chair for ergonomic support. The Lighting Area focuses on ceiling-mounted fixtures to ensure adequate illumination. Additionally, a Multifunctional Area is created with a side table for extra workspace, and a Vertical Storage Area is established with a wall-mounted pegboard for tools and materials.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Central Workspace Area, a modern wooden work table measuring 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended. The Storage Area features colorful fabric bins, each 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters, in red, blue, and green, to organize supplies efficiently. The Seating Area includes a modern, cushioned rolling chair with dimensions of 0.686 meters by 0.681 meters by 1.043 meters, providing comfort and mobility. The Lighting Area is enhanced with a modern white metal ceiling fixture measuring 0.447 meters by 0.441 meters by 0.876 meters. The Multifunctional Area includes a natural wood side table (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters) for additional workspace. The Vertical Storage Area is equipped with a functional white metal pegboard (1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 1.5 meters) for tool organization. A cozy beige fabric rug (2.5 meters by 2.0 meters) is recommended to add warmth and comfort under the work table.

## 4. Scene Graph
The work table, a central element, is placed in the middle of the room, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.75m) allow it to serve as the focal point, providing ample space for crafting activities and ensuring good illumination from the ceiling lights. This central placement facilitates the arrangement of the rolling chair and fabric bins around it, supporting a functional workflow.

Fabric_bin_1, a colorful storage element, is placed to the right of the work table, facing the north wall. Its small size (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.4m) ensures it remains accessible without obstructing movement, contributing to the room's bright aesthetic. Fabric_bin_2 is placed to the right of fabric_bin_1, maintaining a cohesive storage area. This arrangement allows easy access to both bins while keeping the workspace open. Fabric_bin_3 follows the sequence, placed to the right of fabric_bin_2, ensuring accessibility and visual alignment.

The rolling chair is positioned directly in front of the work table, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.686m x 0.681m x 1.043m) allow it to fit comfortably without interfering with the bins or table, providing ergonomic support for crafting activities. The chair's modern style complements the room's vibrant aesthetic.

The lighting fixture is installed on the ceiling, centered above the work table. This placement ensures even illumination across the room, enhancing the crafting area and maintaining balance and symmetry. The side table is placed to the left of the work table, facing the north wall. Its compact size (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.5m) allows it to provide additional workspace without disrupting the room's flow.

The pegboard is mounted on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its placement maximizes vertical storage space, providing easy access to tools and materials from the work table. The rug is placed under the work table, extending slightly beyond its perimeter. Its dimensions (2.5m x 2.0m) ensure comfort for those using the rolling chair and define the crafting area, enhancing the room's aesthetic and functional appeal.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were positioned to ensure functionality and aesthetic appeal, adhering to the user's vision for a bright and inviting craft room. The arrangement maintains balance and proportion, with no spatial conflicts or obstructions, ensuring a cohesive and efficient crafting environment.
