## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a meditation room designed to foster tranquility, emphasizing a minimalist aesthetic. Essential elements include a wooden bench, a ceramic incense holder, and a soft floor cushion, all contributing to a serene environment free from distractions. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user desires a space that supports relaxation and meditation, with a preference for natural materials and a cohesive color palette to maintain visual unity.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into specific functional areas to enhance the meditation experience. The Meditation Cushion Area is centrally located, providing a dedicated space for meditation. The Wooden Bench Area is positioned against the south wall, serving as a seating and posture change zone. The Incense Holder Area is integrated with the bench for easy access during meditation. Additional areas include a Low Table Area for personal items, a Shelf Area for displaying incense and oils, and a Decorative Rug Area to define the central meditation space and add warmth.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Meditation Cushion Area, a beige fabric floor cushion (0.8m x 0.8m x 0.15m) is recommended to provide comfortable seating. The Wooden Bench Area features a minimalist wooden bench (1.2m x 0.4m x 0.45m) in natural wood color. A ceramic incense holder (0.2m x 0.1m x 0.15m) is suggested for the Incense Holder Area, placed on the bench. A low wooden table (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.3m) complements the Meditation Cushion Area, offering a surface for personal items. A wooden shelf (0.6m x 0.2m x 0.5m) is recommended for the Shelf Area to display incense and oils. Finally, a soft beige decorative rug (2.0m x 2.0m x 0.01m) is proposed to define the central meditation space.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden bench is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to create an open space in the center for meditation activities. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.4m x 0.45m) fit well against the wall, providing a peaceful focal point and maximizing open floor space. This placement supports the room's function as a meditation space, maintaining a serene and uncluttered environment.

The ceramic incense holder is placed on the wooden bench, facing the north wall. Its compact size (0.2m x 0.1m x 0.15m) ensures it does not take up much space, maintaining the room's minimalist aesthetic. This placement allows easy access during meditation sessions, aligning with user preferences for a serene environment.

The floor cushion is centrally placed in the room, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.8m x 0.15m) allow it to fit comfortably in the center, providing an unobstructed meditation area. This placement ensures functional interaction with the bench and incense holder, enhancing the meditation experience.

The low table is placed adjacent to the floor cushion in the middle of the room, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.3m) complement the cushion, providing easy access to personal items during meditation. This placement maintains the room's aesthetic and functional requirements.

The shelf is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.2m x 0.5m) ensure it does not overwhelm the space, providing a focal point for displaying incense and oils. This placement enhances the room's function as a meditation space, maintaining aesthetic consistency.

The decorative rug is placed in the middle of the room, under the floor cushion and low table. Its dimensions (2.0m x 2.0m x 0.01m) define the central meditation space, adding warmth and cohesion to the room's elements. This placement supports the user's preference for a tranquil meditation space.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose regarding the placement of the ceramic incense holder and the throw blanket on the wooden bench, as the bench's area was insufficient to accommodate both. To resolve this, the throw blanket was removed, prioritizing the ceramic incense holder due to its functional importance in the meditation practice. This decision aligns with the user's preference for a tranquil meditation room with essential elements like the incense holder and floor cushion.
