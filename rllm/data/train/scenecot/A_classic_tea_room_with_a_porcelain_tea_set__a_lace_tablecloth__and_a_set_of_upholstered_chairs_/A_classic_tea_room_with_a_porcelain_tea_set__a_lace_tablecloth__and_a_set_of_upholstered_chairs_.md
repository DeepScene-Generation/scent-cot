## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a classic tea room characterized by a porcelain tea set, a lace tablecloth, and upholstered chairs. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for a traditional setup. The user emphasizes a classic aesthetic, with a focus on creating a warm and inviting atmosphere suitable for social interaction. Key elements include a central tea table, a side cabinet for display, and a chandelier for ambient lighting. Additional decor such as a rug and classic paintings are considered to enhance the room's style and functionality.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Tea Table Area is the central zone, featuring a round wooden table and upholstered chairs for serving tea and facilitating social interaction. The Display Area includes a side cabinet for showcasing the porcelain tea set. The Lighting Area is defined by a chandelier that provides soft, ambient lighting. Additional substructures include a Decor Area with classic paintings on the north and south walls, and a Comfort Area with a rug to add warmth and comfort to the space.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Tea Table Area, a classic-style round wooden table with dimensions of 1.2 meters in diameter and 0.75 meters in height is recommended, accompanied by four upholstered chairs, each measuring 0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.0 meter. The Display Area features a classic wooden side cabinet (1.0 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.9 meters) for storing and displaying the porcelain tea set. The Lighting Area includes a classic-style chandelier (0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.5 meters) to enhance the room's ambiance. The Decor Area is adorned with two classic paintings, each 1.0 meter by 0.8 meter, placed on opposite walls. A classic red wool rug (2.5 meters by 2.5 meters) is recommended for the Comfort Area, providing a cohesive and inviting environment.

## 4. Scene Graph
The round table is placed centrally in the room, serving as the focal point for the tea room. Its classic style and dark brown wood material align with the user's preference for a traditional aesthetic. The table's central placement ensures balance and proportion, allowing equal access from all sides for the upholstered chairs. The table faces the north wall, providing a balanced view and facilitating social interaction.

The upholstered chairs are arranged symmetrically around the table to maintain a classic tea room setup. Upholstered_chair_1 is placed in front of the table, facing the south wall, while upholstered_chair_2 is behind the table, facing the north wall. Upholstered_chair_3 is positioned to the left of the table, facing the east wall, and upholstered_chair_4 is to the right, facing the west wall. This arrangement ensures functional seating and enhances the room's aesthetic appeal.

The porcelain tea set is placed centrally on the round table, ensuring accessibility from all chairs. Its placement on the table maintains the balance and symmetry of the room's design, aligning with the user's preference for a classic tea room setup. The side cabinet is positioned against the east wall, facing the west wall, serving as a display and storage area for the tea set. This placement ensures accessibility and visibility while complementing the room's classic style.

The chandelier is centrally placed on the ceiling, directly above the round table, to provide even lighting throughout the room. Its classic style enhances the tea room ambiance, illuminating the table and surrounding chairs. The rug is placed in the middle of the room, directly under the round table and chairs, adding warmth and comfort to the space. Its red color complements the dark brown wood of the table and side cabinet, creating a cohesive design.

Painting_1 is placed on the north wall, centrally located to serve as a focal point when viewed from the seating area. Painting_2 is placed on the south wall, creating a symmetrical and balanced aesthetic with Painting_1. Both paintings enhance the room's classic style without interfering with other objects.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited space on the round table, which could not accommodate both the lace tablecloth and the porcelain tea set. Given the user's preference for a classic tea room with a porcelain tea set, the lace tablecloth was removed to resolve the conflict. This decision prioritized the tea set's functionality and aesthetic importance, ensuring the room's design remained harmonious and aligned with the user's vision.
