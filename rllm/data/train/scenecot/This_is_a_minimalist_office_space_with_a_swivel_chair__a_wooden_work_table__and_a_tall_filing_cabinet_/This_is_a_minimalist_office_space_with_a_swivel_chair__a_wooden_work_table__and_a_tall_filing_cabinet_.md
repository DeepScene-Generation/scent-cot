## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a minimalist office that emphasizes simplicity, order, and an open, airy feel. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key items include a swivel chair, a wooden work table, and a tall filing cabinet. The design should maintain an uncluttered appearance, focusing on essential items that align with the minimalist aesthetic. Additional elements like a desk lamp and a rug are considered to enhance functionality and style without compromising the minimalist theme.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional areas based on user requirements. The Work Table Area is central, featuring a wooden work table and a laptop for writing tasks. The Seating Area includes a swivel chair positioned for ergonomic comfort during prolonged writing sessions. The Filing Cabinet Area is designated for document storage, with the cabinet placed against the north wall for easy access. An Open Movement Area is maintained around these elements to ensure easy movement and access, reinforcing the minimalist aesthetic by promoting a spacious environment.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Work Table Area, a minimalist wooden work table (1.5m x 0.8m x 0.75m) is recommended, along with a modern laptop (0.35m x 0.25m x 0.05m) for writing tasks. The Seating Area features a minimalist swivel chair (0.7m x 0.7m x 1.0m) made of metal and fabric, providing comfort and support. The Filing Cabinet Area includes a tall, minimalist metal filing cabinet (0.5m x 0.5m x 2.0m) for organized document storage. A minimalist desk lamp (0.15m x 0.15m x 0.5m) is suggested for adequate lighting, and a gray fabric rug (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.01m) is proposed to define the space and add texture.

## 4. Scene Graph
The work table is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to maximize space efficiency and maintain a minimalist aesthetic. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.8m x 0.75m) allow it to serve as the central focus for writing and working activities. The table's natural wood color aligns with the user's preference for a minimalist office space. The swivel chair is positioned in front of the work table, facing it, ensuring ergonomic access and optimal usability. Its placement in the middle of the room allows for free movement and complements the minimalist style.

The filing cabinet is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, to avoid crowding and maintain accessibility from the work table. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 2.0m) ensure it fits well within the room's layout, maintaining balance and proportion. The laptop is placed on the work table, facing the north wall, ensuring functionality for work and aesthetic alignment with the minimalist theme. The desk lamp is positioned on the right side of the work table, providing effective lighting without obstructing other objects. Its placement maintains balance and enhances the workspace's functionality.

The rug is centered under the swivel chair and partially under the work table, defining the workspace and enhancing the room's aesthetic. Its gray color complements the existing color palette, and its placement ensures no spatial conflicts with other objects. The rug's orientation follows the table's alignment along the south wall, maintaining the room's balance and flow.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the initial placement of the swivel chair behind the work table, as it would be out of bounds. To resolve this, the chair was repositioned in front of the work table, ensuring it remains adjacent and functional. Additionally, the notepad and pen holder were removed due to spatial constraints and their lower priority in the user's minimalist preference. This adjustment maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic coherence, ensuring an uncluttered and spacious environment.
