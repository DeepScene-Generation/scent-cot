## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a lavish walk-in closet characterized by luxury, elegance, and functionality. Key elements include a center island dresser, shoe racks, a chaise lounge, and a full-length mirror. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for these essential objects while ensuring easy movement. The user emphasizes a luxurious aesthetic with functional needs, such as additional storage options for accessories and decor items to enhance the room's opulent feel.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The south and north walls are designated for shoe racks, providing organized storage for footwear. The east wall is reserved for a chaise lounge, offering a relaxation spot. The center of the room is allocated for the island dresser, serving as a focal point and central storage unit. The west wall is intended for a full-length mirror, enhancing functionality and style. Ceiling lighting is planned to contribute to the room's ambiance and visibility.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the center island dresser, a luxury piece with a marble top is recommended to serve as a central storage unit. Two modern-style shoe racks are suggested for the south and north walls, ensuring they fit within the room's luxurious theme. A plush chaise lounge is proposed for the east wall, complementing the room's elegant aesthetic. A modern full-length mirror is recommended for the west wall to facilitate outfit evaluation. Contemporary ceiling lighting is suggested to enhance the room's ambiance. Additional items include a modern jewelry organizer and a decorative sculpture to further accentuate the room's luxurious feel.

## 4. Scene Graph
The island dresser, a central element of the walk-in closet, is placed in the middle of the room, with its long side parallel to the north and south walls. Its dimensions are 1.388 meters by 0.474 meters by 0.557 meters. This central placement ensures it acts as a focal point, providing equal access from all sides and aligning with the user's preference for a luxurious aesthetic.

The first shoe rack is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. It measures 1.5 meters by 0.3 meters by 2.0 meters. This placement ensures stability and accessibility, complementing the central position of the island dresser and aligning with the user's vision of having shoe racks on that side.

The second shoe rack is positioned on the north wall, facing the south wall, maintaining symmetry with the existing shoe rack on the south wall. It shares the same dimensions as the first shoe rack. This setup ensures a balanced, functional, and aesthetically pleasing walk-in closet design.

The chaise lounge is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions are 2.075 meters by 0.846 meters by 0.844 meters. This placement provides a relaxation area without obstructing the storage functionality, aligning with the user's input and maintaining a balanced layout.

The full-length mirror is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall. It measures 0.694 meters by 0.089 meters by 1.544 meters. This placement allows it to be easily accessible and visible for outfit evaluation, contributing to the room's balance and symmetry.

The ceiling lighting is centrally placed on the ceiling, directly above the island dresser, with dimensions of 0.828 meters by 0.828 meters by 1.019 meters. It faces downward to illuminate the room effectively, complementing the luxury style and providing functional lighting.

The jewelry organizer is placed on top of the island dresser, facing the north wall. Its dimensions are 0.4 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.5 meters. This placement ensures it serves its purpose without causing disruptions in the room's layout, aligning with the dresser's orientation.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited area on the island dresser, which could not accommodate both the jewelry organizer and the decorative sculpture. To resolve this, the decorative sculpture was removed, as the jewelry organizer holds greater functional importance for the user, aligning with their preference for a lavish walk-in closet with a focus on storage and organization.

            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.0445-0.0445), y(0.347-4.6530000000000005)
            - Final coordinates: x=0.0445, y=3.7894918790013783, z=0.772
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.0445, y: 3.7894918790013783, z: 0.772
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Final coordinates: x=0.0445, y=3.7894918790013783, z=0.772
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.0445, y: 3.7894918790013783, z: 0.772
