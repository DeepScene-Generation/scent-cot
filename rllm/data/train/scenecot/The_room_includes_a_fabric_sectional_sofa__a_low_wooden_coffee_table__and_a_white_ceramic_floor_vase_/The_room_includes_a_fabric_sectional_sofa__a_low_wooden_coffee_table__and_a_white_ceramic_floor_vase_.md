## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user's primary goal is to create a cozy living room that emphasizes comfort and aesthetics. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user desires a fabric sectional sofa as the main seating area, complemented by a low wooden coffee table and a white ceramic floor vase. The sectional sofa is intended to provide comfort and opportunities for socializing, while the coffee table offers a functional surface for items, enhancing both functionality and style. The white ceramic vase serves as an elegant decorative touch. Additional elements such as a throw blanket, cushions, a decorative tray, a small sculpture, and a small plant are recommended to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic without overcrowding the space.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Sectional Sofa Area is the primary seating zone, designed for relaxation and socializing. The Coffee Table Area serves as a central surface space for placing items and enhancing the room's functionality. The Decorative Vase Area is a focal point that adds elegance and can be complemented by a small plant to introduce a natural element. Each substructure is carefully planned to ensure the room remains functional and aesthetically pleasing without exceeding the user's object limit.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sectional Sofa Area, a modern gray fabric sectional sofa is recommended, accompanied by a navy blue wool throw blanket and a light gray cushion to enhance comfort and support. The Coffee Table Area features a rustic brown wooden coffee table, complemented by an elegant gold metal decorative tray and a small white ceramic sculpture for organization and decoration. A small green plant is also suggested to add a natural touch. The Decorative Vase Area includes a minimalist white ceramic floor vase, with a recommendation to place a small plant nearby to enhance visual appeal and introduce a natural element.

## 4. Scene Graph
The sectional sofa, a large modern piece, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement provides stability and balance, ensuring the sofa does not obstruct the room's flow. Its dimensions (3.0m x 2.0m x 0.9m) allow it to fit comfortably, serving as a focal point for socializing and relaxation. The throw blanket, intended for warmth and comfort, is draped over the arm of the sectional sofa, visible from the room entrance. Its placement adds a pop of color and texture, aligning with the sofa's orientation. The cushion, light gray in color, is placed on the sectional sofa, providing additional comfort and support. Its dimensions (0.449m x 0.407m x 0.163m) ensure it fits without overwhelming the space.

The coffee table, a rustic wooden piece, is positioned in front of the sectional sofa, centered in the middle of the room. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.8m x 0.4m) allow it to fit without causing obstruction, maintaining balance and proportion. The decorative tray, small and elegant, is placed on the coffee table, organizing items and enhancing the aesthetic. The small sculpture, also on the coffee table, provides a focal point without overcrowding, complementing the neutral palette. The floor vase, a tall minimalist piece, is placed on the east wall, away from foot traffic, ensuring it stands out without obstructing movement. Finally, the small plant is placed on the coffee table, adding a natural element and enhancing the room's cozy ambiance.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects fit comfortably within the room's dimensions, adhering to user preferences and design principles. The placement of each object ensures functionality and aesthetic appeal, maintaining balance and proportion throughout the space.
