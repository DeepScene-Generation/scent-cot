## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires an industrial-style loft that emphasizes comfort and style through specific furniture choices, including a leather swivel chair, a rustic wooden coffee table, and a metal floor lamp. These items are essential to achieving the desired aesthetic and functionality. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for additional elements that enhance the industrial theme. The user also expressed interest in incorporating a bookshelf, an industrial-style rug, an art piece, and a side table to further define the space and add character.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Seating Area is centered around the leather swivel chair, providing a comfortable space for relaxation and social interaction. The Surface Area is defined by the rustic wooden coffee table, offering a stable and durable space for personal items. The Lighting Area is enhanced by the metal floor lamp, providing focused illumination for reading or tasks. Additional substructures include the Storage Area, represented by the industrial bookshelf, and the Decorative Area, highlighted by the industrial art piece. The Rug Area defines the seating zone, while the Side Table Area offers additional surface space.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a leather swivel chair is recommended for its ergonomic design and industrial aesthetic. The Surface Area features a rustic wooden coffee table, emphasizing stability and durability. The Lighting Area includes a metal floor lamp to enhance ambiance and functionality. The Storage Area is complemented by an industrial bookshelf for additional storage. The Decorative Area is enriched with an industrial art piece to add visual interest. An industrial rug is suggested to define the seating area, and a side table provides extra surface space, all adhering to the industrial style.

## 4. Scene Graph
The leather swivel chair, a central element of the Seating Area, is placed towards the middle of the room, facing the north wall. This placement allows for flexibility in future arrangements and ensures the chair is part of a conversation zone. Its compact size (0.8m x 0.8m x 1.0m) fits well in the space, maintaining balance and proportion while adhering to the industrial aesthetic.

The rustic wooden coffee table is positioned directly in front of the leather swivel chair, also facing the north wall. This placement maximizes functionality as a surface area and aligns with the industrial style. The table's dimensions (1.2m x 0.8m x 0.4m) allow it to fit comfortably without overwhelming the space, ensuring both objects complement each other in color and style.

The metal floor lamp is placed on the east side of the rustic wooden coffee table, facing the west wall. This location provides adequate lighting for the seating area without obstructing movement or the view. The lamp's dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.8m) ensure it fits comfortably, enhancing both ambiance and usability.

The industrial bookshelf is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement provides stability and avoids blocking the view or movement in the room. The bookshelf's dimensions (1.0m x 0.3m x 2.0m) allow it to serve as a functional storage space while maintaining the industrial aesthetic.

The industrial rug is centered beneath the leather swivel chair and rustic wooden coffee table, defining the seating area. Its size (2.0m x 1.5m) fits comfortably beneath the existing furniture, adding a layer of texture and enhancing the aesthetic appeal.

The industrial art piece is mounted on the west wall, above the industrial bookshelf, facing the east wall. This placement balances the industrial elements and enhances the room's ambiance with its decorative nature. The art piece's dimensions (1.5m x 0.1m x 1.0m) fit well without interfering with the bookshelf's functionality.

The side table is placed adjacent to the leather swivel chair on its left side, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.5m) fit comfortably, providing additional surface space for personal items. This placement enhances the seating area's usability while preserving the industrial loft's open and raw aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. Each object was carefully positioned to avoid spatial conflicts, ensuring a harmonious and functional layout that aligns with the user's preferences for an industrial-style loft. The arrangement maintains balance and proportion, enhancing both the aesthetic and functional appeal of the room.
