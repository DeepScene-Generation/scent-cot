## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a stylish living space characterized by a plush gray fabric sofa, a marble coffee table, and a wooden bookshelf. The room's ambiance is defined by a cohesive and sophisticated color scheme, balanced furniture proportions, and a central focal point with the coffee table. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes the importance of maintaining a stylish aesthetic while ensuring functional and ergonomic furniture placement.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Seating Area includes the plush gray fabric sofa against the south wall, providing a comfortable seating option while maintaining ergonomic and aesthetic balance. The Bookshelf Area features a wooden bookshelf against the east wall, contributing to the room's sophisticated color scheme and balance. The Central Area highlights the marble coffee table as a focal point, providing a surface for drinks or decorative items. Additional areas include the Lighting Area, with a modern ceiling fixture for ambient lighting, and a Decorative Area for personal touches like a vase or art piece.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a modern-style gray fabric sofa with dimensions of 2.2 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.85 meters is recommended. The Bookshelf Area features a classic-style wooden bookshelf measuring 1.2 meters by 0.3 meters by 2.0 meters. In the Central Area, a modern marble coffee table with dimensions of 1.0 meter by 0.6 meter by 0.4 meter is suggested. The Lighting Area includes a modern ceiling fixture with dimensions of 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters. Additional recommendations include a modern-style armchair, a floor lamp for additional lighting, a rug to define the central area, and a decorative vase to enhance the room's aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The sofa is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, as it is a key piece of furniture that contributes to a stylish living space. Its dimensions (2.2m x 0.9m x 0.85m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, providing a spacious and welcoming view of the room. This placement leaves ample space in front of the sofa for the coffee table and bookshelf, adhering to both aesthetic and functional principles.

The bookshelf is positioned against the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement ensures easy access for storage while maintaining balance in the room's design. The bookshelf's dimensions (1.2m x 0.3m x 2.0m) fit well against the wall, complementing the sofa without overwhelming the space. Its strategic placement maintains a balanced and functional living space.

The coffee table is centrally placed in front of the sofa, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.6m x 0.4m) allow it to serve as a central piece for placing items such as magazines, drinks, or decorative items. This placement enhances the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal, maintaining balance and proportion without obstructing movement or access to other items.

The ceiling fixture is installed in the middle of the room, above the coffee table, to provide even lighting across the space. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m) ensure it does not interfere with floor objects while enhancing the room's modern aesthetic. This placement provides optimal illumination for the seating area, complementing the existing modern and classic styles of the sofa and bookshelf.

The floor lamp is placed to the left of the sofa, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.5m) allow it to provide additional lighting for the seating area without interfering with the room's flow. This placement enhances the ambiance and functionality of the seating area, complementing the modern style of the sofa.

The vase is placed on the coffee table, centrally positioned for aesthetic balance. Its dimensions (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.4m) ensure it serves its decorative purpose without impeding the use of the table. This placement makes the vase a focal point visible from the sofa and armchair, adding a pop of color and enhancing the room's visual appeal.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified regarding the placement of the armchair and rug. The width of the coffee table was too small to accommodate the armchair to the right of it, leading to a spatial conflict. To resolve this, the armchair and rug were removed based on their lower functional priority compared to the sofa, coffee table, and bookshelf. This decision ensures the room maintains its stylish aesthetic and functional layout, aligning with the user's preferences.
