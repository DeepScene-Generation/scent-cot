## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a sleek game room featuring a billiard table, a high-quality sound system, and a leather reclining chair. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, is designed to incorporate elements such as the south wall, north wall, west wall, east wall, the middle of the room, and the ceiling. The aesthetic focus is on modernity and minimalism, with an emphasis on functionality and a cozy atmosphere. Additional elements like modern lighting, a side table, and wall art are suggested to enhance the room's sleek and inviting ambiance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into specific functional areas: the Billiard Table Area, the Sound System Zone, the Reclining Chair Area, and the Open Movement Space. The Billiard Table Area is the central focus, requiring ample space for movement and play. The Sound System Zone, located on the south wall, is designed to enhance the gaming experience with a sleek, minimalistic setup. The Reclining Chair Area, also on the south wall, provides a cozy seating option adjacent to the sound system. The Open Movement Space ensures easy accessibility and flow throughout the room, balancing functionality with an inviting atmosphere.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Billiard Table Area, a modern billiard table made of wood and felt, measuring 2.8 meters by 1.5 meters by 0.8 meters, is recommended. The Sound System Zone features a modern sound system made of metal and plastic, measuring 1.0 meter by 0.4 meters by 1.0 meter. In the Reclining Chair Area, a luxurious leather reclining chair measuring 1.0 meter by 0.9 meters by 1.1 meters is suggested. A small side table, measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.6 meters, complements the chair. Modern ceiling lights, a minimalist wall art piece, a grey wool rug, and a modern bookshelf are also recommended to enhance the room's sleek and cozy aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The billiard table is placed centrally in the room, as it is the focal point and requires ample space for play. Its dimensions (2.8m x 1.5m x 0.8m) fit well in the middle, allowing for balanced aesthetics and functionality. The table faces no specific wall, ensuring optimal use of space and accessibility.

The sound system is positioned on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures it enhances the gaming experience without obstructing movement. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.4m x 1.0m) allow it to fit snugly against the wall, maintaining the room's sleek aesthetic.

The reclining chair is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This positioning allows for relaxation while watching or participating in games. The chair's dimensions (1.0m x 0.9m x 1.1m) ensure it does not obstruct pathways or sightlines.

The side table is placed adjacent to the reclining chair on the east wall, facing the west wall. Its small size (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.6m) allows it to serve its purpose without overwhelming the space, providing functionality and maintaining the modern aesthetic.

Ceiling lights are installed directly above the billiard table, ensuring even illumination. The lights' modern style complements the room's theme, and their placement on the ceiling ensures they do not interfere with activities.

The wall art is placed on the south wall above the sound system, facing the north wall. Its minimalist design enhances the room's ambiance without competing with the billiard table, maintaining balance and proportion.

The rug is placed centrally under the billiard table, covering a portion of the floor space. Its dimensions (3.0m x 2.0m x 0.01m) allow it to extend beyond the table slightly, providing comfort and visual cohesion.

The bookshelf is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.4m x 2.0m) ensure it provides storage without obstructing movement or access to the billiard table, maintaining balance and accessibility.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed in a manner that respects the room's dimensions and user preferences, ensuring a sleek, modern aesthetic and functional layout.
