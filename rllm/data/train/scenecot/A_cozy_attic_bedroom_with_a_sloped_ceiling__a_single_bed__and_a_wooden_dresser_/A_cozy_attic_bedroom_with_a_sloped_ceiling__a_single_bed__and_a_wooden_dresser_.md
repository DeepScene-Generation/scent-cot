## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a cozy attic bedroom characterized by a sloped ceiling, a single bed, and a wooden dresser. The room is intended to be a tranquil retreat with natural wood tones and a warm atmosphere. The layout includes south, north, west, and east walls, as well as the middle of the room and ceiling. The primary functional needs include a sleeping area with a single bed, a storage area with a wooden dresser, and a central open area for movement and relaxation. The user prefers a harmonious environment with essential furniture and decor items that align with the room's cozy aesthetic.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures based on the user's requirements. The Sleeping Area includes the single bed, which is essential for the room's function. Adjacent to this is the Bedside Area, featuring a bedside table and lamp to enhance functionality and aesthetics. The Storage Area is defined by the wooden dresser, with a mirror to enhance usability and aesthetics by creating an illusion of more space. The Central Open Area ensures easy movement and maximizes natural light, with a small rug to define the space and add warmth. A Reading Area was considered but ultimately excluded due to spatial constraints.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sleeping Area, a cozy wooden single bed with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.5 meters is recommended. The Bedside Area includes a rustic wooden bedside table (0.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.6 meters) and a vintage bronze lamp (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters) to provide lighting. The Storage Area features a traditional wooden dresser (1.2 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter) with a minimalist silver mirror (0.8 meters by 0.1 meter by 1.0 meter) to enhance functionality. The Central Open Area is defined by a bohemian-style wool rug (2.0 meters by 1.5 meters by 0.02 meters) to add comfort and aesthetic appeal.

## 4. Scene Graph
The single bed is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to maximize space utilization and create a cozy atmosphere. This placement takes advantage of the sloped ceiling typical of an attic, effectively utilizing the lower ceiling height and creating an intimate space. The bed's dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.5m) fit well against the south wall, ensuring no spatial conflict with other objects and maintaining balance and functionality.

The bedside table is positioned to the right of the single bed, adjacent to it, and facing the north wall. This placement ensures functionality and aesthetic appeal, keeping in line with the user's vision of a cozy attic bedroom. The bedside table's dimensions (0.5m x 0.4m x 0.6m) allow it to fit comfortably next to the bed, providing space for personal items and lighting.

The lamp is placed on the bedside table, facing the north wall, ensuring it provides adequate lighting for the bed while maintaining a cohesive and cozy aesthetic. The lamp's vintage style and bronze color complement the rustic wooden bedside table and the natural wood bed, enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal. Its dimensions (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) are suitable for placement on the bedside table, providing necessary lighting without overwhelming the space.

The wooden dresser is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement keeps the dresser accessible from the bed while maintaining visual balance and adhering to the cozy aesthetic. The dresser's dimensions (1.2m x 0.5m x 1.0m) ensure it fits comfortably against the north wall without interfering with the attic's sloped ceiling.

The mirror is placed against the north wall, next to the wooden dresser, facing the south wall. This placement ensures that the mirror is functionally integrated into the dressing area, providing reflection capabilities without causing spatial conflicts. The mirror's minimalist style and silver color create a balanced contrast with the other wooden elements, enhancing the room's aesthetic.

The rug is placed in the middle of the floor, providing a central, unifying aesthetic element that complements the cozy and rustic decor of the room. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.02m) allow it to fit comfortably in the open area without impeding movement, adding comfort and warmth to the room's central area.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, a conflict was identified with the reading chair, which could not be placed left of the bedside table due to the presence of the single bed. Additionally, the width of the bedside table was too small to accommodate the chair right of it, and the length of the south wall was insufficient to accommodate all objects. To resolve these conflicts, the reading chair was removed based on its lower functional priority compared to the essential elements of the cozy attic bedroom, such as the single bed and wooden dresser.
