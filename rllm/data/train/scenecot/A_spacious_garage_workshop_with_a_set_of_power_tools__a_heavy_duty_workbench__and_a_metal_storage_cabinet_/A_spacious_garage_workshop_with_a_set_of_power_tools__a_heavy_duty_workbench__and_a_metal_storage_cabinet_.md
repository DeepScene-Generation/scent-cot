## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a spacious garage workshop that emphasizes crafting, organized tool storage, and maneuverability. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user's preferences include a heavy-duty workbench, a set of power tools, and a metal storage cabinet, all within an industrial aesthetic. The functional needs focus on efficient organization and accessibility, with a clear open area for maneuvering large projects and temporary vehicle parking. The user also desires enhanced functionality and aesthetic appeal through additional objects like a workbench chair, tool rack, pegboard, task lighting, and a utility cart.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The garage workshop is divided into several key substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Workbench Area is designated for crafting activities and includes a robust workbench. The Tool and Storage Area is intended for organized tool storage and includes a tool rack and metal storage cabinet. The Open Maneuvering Area is kept clear to facilitate the movement of large projects and temporary vehicle parking. Additionally, a Ventilation and Lighting System is incorporated to enhance the workshop's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Workbench Area, an industrial-style workbench measuring 2.0 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.9 meters is recommended. The Tool and Storage Area features a metal tool rack (1.2 meters by 0.3 meters by 2.0 meters) and a metal storage cabinet (0.962 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.86 meters) for efficient organization. The Lighting System includes a task light (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.7 meters) to provide focused illumination. A power tool set (1.0 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters) is recommended for crafting activities, and a utility cart (0.8 meters by 0.5 meters) is suggested for tool transport, though it was ultimately removed due to space constraints.

## 4. Scene Graph
The workbench is a crucial element in the garage workshop, placed on the north wall to maximize workspace efficiency and align with the industrial style. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.8m x 0.9m) fit comfortably along the north wall, leaving ample space for movement and additional storage. This placement ensures the workbench is the focal point of the workspace, providing easy accessibility and maintaining openness in the room's center.

The tool rack is positioned on the north wall, to the right of the workbench, ensuring tools are readily accessible to someone working at the bench. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.3m x 2.0m) allow it to fit without interfering with the workbench, maintaining the workshop's functionality and balance.

The metal storage cabinet is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement provides accessibility while maintaining an open workspace, aligning with the user's desire for a spacious workshop. The cabinet's dimensions (0.962m x 0.4m x 1.86m) ensure it does not crowd the central area.

The task light is mounted on the north wall, directly above the workbench, to effectively illuminate the workbench area. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.7m) ensure it does not interfere with other objects, enhancing the workspace's functionality without cluttering the floor space.

The power tool set is placed on the workbench, which is on the north wall. This placement is functional for crafting activities and aligns with the user's vision of a spacious and well-organized workshop. The power tool set's dimensions (1.0m x 0.5m x 0.5m) fit comfortably on the workbench, ensuring easy access during crafting activities.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited length of the north wall, which could not accommodate all intended objects. The utility cart, workbench chair, and pegboard were considered for removal. Ultimately, the utility cart was deleted as it was deemed less critical to the user's preference for a spacious workshop with a focus on crafting and tool storage. This resolution maintained the room's functionality and adhered to the user's vision.
