## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern bedroom that includes a king-sized bed, a sleek bedside table, and a large wardrobe. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for modern furniture that maintains a sleek, uncluttered design. The user emphasizes the need for functionality, with a focus on restful sleep, convenient access to personal items, and adequate storage. Additional elements such as a modern lamp, chair, rug, and wall art are suggested to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal, with a total object count not exceeding 14 to maintain a minimalist approach.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Sleeping Area is centered around the king-sized bed, positioned for optimal rest and relaxation. The Storage Area is designated for the large wardrobe, providing ample space for clothing and personal items. The Bedside Area includes a sleek bedside table and lamp for easy access to essentials. The Seating Area features a modern chair for additional seating, while the Decorative Area includes a rug and wall art to enhance the room's aesthetic appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sleeping Area, a modern king-sized bed with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.8 meters by 0.5 meters is recommended. The Bedside Area includes a modern bedside table (0.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.5 meters) and a sleek metal lamp (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters) to provide lighting. The Storage Area features a large modern wardrobe (2.0 meters by 0.6 meters by 2.0 meters) for storing clothing. The Seating Area includes a modern metal chair (0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.9 meters) for additional seating. The Decorative Area is enhanced with a modern fabric rug (2.0 meters by 1.5 meters by 0.02 meters) and abstract canvas wall art (0.95 meters by 0.02 meters by 1.4 meters) to add texture and visual interest.

## 4. Scene Graph
The king-sized bed is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, ensuring it is the focal point of the room. This placement allows for additional furniture to be easily integrated around it, maintaining balance and symmetry with space for bedside tables on either side. The bed's dimensions (2.0m x 1.8m x 0.5m) ensure it occupies a substantial portion of the room, aligning with the user's request for a modern, sleek design.

The bedside table is placed to the right of the bed, on the north wall, maintaining its modern aesthetic and functionality. It is adjacent to the bed, facing the south wall, ensuring easy access from the bed. The table's dimensions (0.5m x 0.4m x 0.5m) complement the bed's size and style, enhancing the room's modern theme.

The lamp is placed on the bedside table, facing the south wall, maintaining consistent orientation with the bedside table and bed. The lamp's small size (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) ensures it does not interfere with the bed's placement or the room's spatial flow, providing convenient lighting for the bed area.

The wardrobe is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, which is in line with the bed and bedside table. This arrangement maintains balance, adheres to design principles, and satisfies user preferences for a modern bedroom layout. The wardrobe's dimensions (2.0m x 0.6m x 2.0m) ensure it provides ample storage without obstructing movement.

The chair is placed in the north-west corner of the room, facing the east wall. It is not adjacent to any furniture, maintaining its independence and allowing free movement. The chair's dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.9m) ensure it provides additional seating without compromising the room's modern aesthetic.

The rug is placed in the middle of the room, with no direct adjacency to other objects, enhancing the room's aesthetic and providing a soft surface underfoot. The rug's dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.02m) allow it to fit comfortably within the room, defining the space without obstructing movement.

The wall art is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement ensures it does not interfere with the existing furniture and contributes to the room's aesthetic balance. The wall art's dimensions (0.95m x 0.02m x 1.4m) ensure it fits comfortably on the wall, enhancing the room's modern aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The room's layout and object placements were carefully considered to ensure there were no spatial conflicts or obstructions, maintaining the user's preference for a modern, functional bedroom.
