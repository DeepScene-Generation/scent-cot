## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a contemporary-styled living room with a focus on minimalism and functionality. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a fabric sofa, a wooden coffee table, and a ceramic planter. The user emphasizes comfortable seating, central table accessibility, and air quality improvement through plants. The design should maintain a sleek and modern aesthetic, avoiding clutter while ensuring the total number of items does not exceed twelve.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key areas based on the user's requirements. The Fabric Sofa Area serves as the primary seating zone, while the Wooden Coffee Table Area is central for accessibility and interaction. The Ceramic Planter Area enhances air quality and adds a decorative touch. Additionally, a Movement and Stability Area ensures the room remains open and functional, allowing for easy navigation and balance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Fabric Sofa Area, a contemporary gray fabric sofa measuring 2.0 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.8 meters is recommended. The Wooden Coffee Table Area features a square wooden coffee table (1.0 meters by 1.0 meters by 0.4 meters) that complements the sofa. A white ceramic planter (0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.8 meters) is suggested for the Planter Area to enhance air quality. Additional recommendations include a beige wool rug (2.0 meters by 2.0 meters), a modern black metal floor lamp (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.7 meters), a white wooden shelf unit (1.2 meters by 0.4 meters by 2.0 meters), multicolor canvas artwork (1.0 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.5 meters), a light blue fabric cushion (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters), and a transparent glass vase (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters).

## 4. Scene Graph
The fabric sofa, a central seating element, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement optimizes space usage and aligns with the contemporary style, providing a foundation for further furniture placement. The coffee table is positioned in front of the sofa, centrally located to ensure accessibility and maintain aesthetic appeal. Its dimensions allow it to fit comfortably without overwhelming the space. The ceramic planter is placed on the floor to the left of the sofa, enhancing the room's balance and adding a decorative element without cluttering the central area. The wool rug is placed under the coffee table, extending slightly beyond its perimeter to anchor the seating arrangement visually. The floor lamp is positioned to the right of the sofa, providing practical lighting while complementing the room's modern style. The shelf unit is placed against the north wall, offering storage and display space without disrupting the room's balance. The artwork is hung on the east wall, serving as a focal point visible from the seating area. The cushion is placed on the sofa, adding comfort and a touch of color. Finally, the vase is placed on the coffee table, enhancing the room's decor with its contemporary style.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the side table's placement, as it could not be positioned left of the floor lamp due to the sofa's presence. To resolve this, the side table was removed, as it was deemed less critical to the user's preferences and room functionality. Additionally, the area on the sofa was too small to accommodate both cushions, leading to the removal of cushion_2 to maintain the room's contemporary style and functionality.

            - x_max = 5.0 - 0.0/2 - 0.05/2 = 4.975
            - y_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 1.0/2 = 0.5
            - y_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 1.0/2 = 4.5
            - z_min = 1.5 - 3.0/2 + 1.5/2 = 0.75
            - z_max = 1.5 + 3.0/2 - 1.5/2 = 2.25
        - conclusion: Possible position: (4.975, 4.975, 0.5, 4.5, 0.75, 2.25)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(4.975-4.975), y(0.5-4.5)
            - Final coordinates: x=4.975, y=1.0691, z=0.9267
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 4.975, y: 1.0691, z: 0.9267
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Final coordinates: x=4.975, y=1.0691, z=0.9267
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 4.975, y: 1.0691, z: 0.9267
