## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a vintage-style room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary elements include a vintage-style wooden bookcase and a brown leather reclining chair, emphasizing comfort and a cohesive aesthetic. The room should also feature a central reading light to ensure adequate illumination. Additional recommendations include a small side table, a soft area rug, and decorative accessories like a vintage-style clock and potted plants to enhance the room's warmth and functionality. The total number of objects should not exceed 12, focusing on essential items that complement the vintage theme.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main substructures: the Bookcase Area, the Seating Area, and the Lighting Area. The Bookcase Area is designated for the vintage-style wooden bookcase, serving as a focal point for storing books. The Seating Area includes the brown leather reclining chair, providing a comfortable spot for reading. The Lighting Area focuses on the central reading light, ensuring the room is well-lit and maintains a cozy atmosphere. Additional elements like a side table and area rug are intended to define and enhance the seating space.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Bookcase Area, a large vintage-style wooden bookcase with a dark brown finish is recommended to store books and complement the room's aesthetic. The Seating Area features a brown leather reclining chair, offering comfort and style. A vintage-style reading light is suggested for the Lighting Area to provide adequate illumination. A small side table is recommended next to the chair for convenience, along with a vintage-style woolen area rug to define the space. Decorative items like a vintage clock and potted plants are proposed to add warmth and life to the room.

## 4. Scene Graph
The vintage-style wooden bookcase is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions are 1.5 meters in length, 0.4 meters in width, and 2.0 meters in height. This placement ensures stability and maximizes space, making the bookcase a focal point upon entering the room. The dark brown color complements the vintage style, and its position allows for easy access and visibility.

The brown leather reclining chair is positioned on the north wall, to the right of the bookcase, facing the south wall. Measuring 1.073 meters in length, 0.851 meters in width, and 0.975 meters in height, the chair provides a comfortable reading spot. Its proximity to the bookcase allows for easy access to books, maintaining balance and cohesion in the vintage-themed room.

The vintage-style woolen area rug, measuring 2.0 meters by 2.0 meters, is placed centrally in the middle of the room. This placement defines the seating area and unifies the furniture arrangement, adding warmth and comfort. The rug's beige color complements the vintage aesthetic and enhances the room's visual appeal.

## 5. Global Check
Several conflicts arose during the placement process. The side table was too small to accommodate both the vintage clock and a potted plant, leading to the removal of the potted plant. Additionally, the north wall could not accommodate all intended objects, resulting in the deletion of the side table, vintage clock, and a second potted plant. The reading light was also removed due to spatial constraints. These adjustments were made to prioritize the user's preference for a vintage-style wooden bookcase and a comfortable reclining chair, ensuring the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal are maintained.
