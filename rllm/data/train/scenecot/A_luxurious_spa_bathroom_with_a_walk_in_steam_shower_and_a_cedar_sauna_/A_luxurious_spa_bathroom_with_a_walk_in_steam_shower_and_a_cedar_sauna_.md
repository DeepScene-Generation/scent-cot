## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user's vision is to transform a 5.0m x 5.0m x 3.0m room into a luxurious spa bathroom. Key elements include a walk-in steam shower and a cedar sauna, which are essential for creating a relaxing and opulent atmosphere. The user also desires a vanity unit with a mirror, polished marble tiles, and a central mat to enhance the room's luxurious and functional ambiance. Additional features such as seating inside the sauna, a towel rack, wall-mounted storage for toiletries, a small bench, and ambient lighting fixtures are included to augment both functionality and luxury. The total number of objects is limited to 11 to maintain a cohesive and serene environment.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to accommodate the user's requirements. The north wall is designated for the steam shower, serving as a focal point for relaxation. The south wall houses the cedar sauna, providing a space for heat therapy. The west wall is allocated for the vanity unit and mirror, facilitating grooming activities. The east wall is reserved for the towel rack, ensuring easy access to towels. The middle of the room is designated for the central mat, offering comfort and luxury. The ceiling is utilized for the lighting fixture, providing ambient illumination. These substructures collectively create a balanced and functional spa bathroom.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the steam shower area, a luxurious glass steam shower measuring 2.0m x 1.5m x 2.5m is recommended. The cedar sauna, also measuring 2.0m x 1.5m x 2.5m, is suggested for the heat therapy area. The vanity unit, made of marble and measuring 1.5m x 0.6m x 0.9m, is paired with a modern glass mirror (1.5m x 0.1m x 1.0m) for the grooming area. A plush cream-colored central mat (1.8m x 1.2m x 0.02m) is proposed for the middle of the room. A modern metal towel rack (0.8m x 0.2m x 1.0m) is recommended for the east wall. Additional storage is provided by a modern wooden wall storage unit (0.6m x 0.3m x 0.8m) adjacent to the vanity. A luxurious marble small bench (1.0m x 0.4m x 0.45m) is suggested near the steam shower. Finally, a modern metal lighting fixture (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.3m) is recommended for the ceiling to enhance the room's ambiance.

## 4. Scene Graph
The steam shower is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, to serve as a central element of relaxation. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m x 2.5m) fit well within the room, and its glass material adds a modern touch. This placement ensures stability and easy access to plumbing, making it a visual anchor for the room.

The cedar sauna is positioned against the south wall, facing the north wall, complementing the steam shower. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m x 2.5m) allow it to fit comfortably, maintaining balance and flow within the room. This placement facilitates easy movement between the sauna and shower, enhancing functionality.

The vanity unit is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, to provide a functional grooming area. Its marble material and dimensions (1.5m x 0.6m x 0.9m) align with the luxurious theme. The mirror is placed above the vanity, ensuring functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The central mat is placed in the middle of the room, providing a plush and comfortable surface. Its dimensions (1.8m x 1.2m x 0.02m) allow it to serve as a transition point between the steam shower, sauna, and vanity unit, enhancing the room's luxurious ambiance.

The towel rack is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall, ensuring easy access from both the steam shower and sauna. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.2m x 1.0m) fit comfortably, maintaining functionality and aesthetic balance.

The wall storage unit is placed on the west wall, adjacent to the vanity unit, providing additional storage for grooming items. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.3m x 0.8m) complement the existing modern elements, enhancing functionality without disrupting the room's open feel.

The small bench is placed against the north wall, to the left of the steam shower, facing the south wall. Its marble material and dimensions (1.0m x 0.4m x 0.45m) provide a practical seating area, enhancing the luxurious feel and functionality.

The lighting fixture is placed on the ceiling in the middle of the room, ensuring even illumination. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.3m) allow it to enhance the luxurious and relaxing atmosphere of the spa bathroom.
