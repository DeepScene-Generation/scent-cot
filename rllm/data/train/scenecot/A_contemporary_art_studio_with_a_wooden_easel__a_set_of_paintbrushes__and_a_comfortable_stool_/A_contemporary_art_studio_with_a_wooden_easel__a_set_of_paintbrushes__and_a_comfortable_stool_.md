## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a contemporary art studio that balances functionality and aesthetics, with a focus on essential elements such as a wooden easel, a set of paintbrushes, and a comfortable stool. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, and it features strategic natural lighting from windows on the north and south walls. The user emphasizes an open layout to maintain an uncluttered and well-lit space, with additional storage solutions to support this openness. The studio should serve as both a practical workspace and a source of inspiration.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The studio is divided into several key substructures: the 'Central Easel Area' serves as the focal point, requiring a sturdy wooden easel that supports the artistic process while aligning with the studio's minimalistic design. The 'Brush Storage and Seating' area includes a holder for paintbrushes and a stool for ergonomic seating, ensuring accessibility and comfort. The 'Seating Area' provides additional ergonomic support with an artist stool designed for prolonged use. The 'Open Layout with Natural Light' ensures the space remains uncluttered and well-lit, with potential for additional storage solutions to maintain this openness.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the 'Central Easel Area', a contemporary wooden easel with dimensions of 0.698 meters by 0.523 meters by 1.291 meters is recommended. The 'Brush Storage and Seating' area includes a minimalist wooden paintbrush holder (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.3 meters) and a contemporary stool (0.386 meters by 0.43 meters by 0.807 meters) made of metal and leather. The 'Open Layout with Natural Light' is supported by a modern metal storage shelf (1.0 meter by 0.4 meters by 1.8 meters) and a minimalist wooden artist table (1.2 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.75 meters) for additional workspace. A modern metal canvas rack (0.8 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.5 meters) and an eclectic cork inspiration board (1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 1.2 meters) are also recommended to enhance functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 4. Scene Graph
The easel, a central element for painting, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This positioning ensures it acts as a focal point and allows for optimal functionality and aesthetic appeal in the art studio. The easel's dimensions (0.698m x 0.523m x 1.291m) require sufficient space around it for movement and accessing painting materials, and its placement aligns with the user's preference for a contemporary art studio.

The paintbrush holder, complementing the wooden easel in both style and material, is placed on the floor adjacent to the easel on the north wall. This placement ensures it is functional, accessible, and complements the existing studio setup, maintaining balance and proportion by being near the easel.

The stool is placed directly in front of the easel, facing the north wall. This arrangement ensures the artist can comfortably use the stool while painting at the easel. The stool's contemporary style, black color, and metal and leather material contribute to the studio's aesthetic.

The storage shelf is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. This position ensures it is accessible for storing art supplies, complements the room's modern style, and maintains an open layout with natural light. The shelf's dimensions (1.0m x 0.4m x 1.8m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall without obstructing movement.

The artist table is placed on the east wall, facing the north wall, providing a complementary workspace to the existing easel setup. This placement allows easy access to art supplies on the storage shelf and ensures a functional and aesthetically pleasing layout. The table's dimensions (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.75m) fit well within the room's layout.

The canvas rack is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall, to the right of the storage shelf. This position ensures the rack is easily accessible when painting and does not obstruct movement within the room. The rack's dimensions (0.8m x 0.4m x 1.5m) allow it to fit comfortably alongside the other storage elements.

The inspiration board is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement ensures it is visible from both the easel and the artist table, enhancing its functionality as a display area. The board's thin profile (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.2m) ensures it does not protrude significantly, allowing for easy movement around it.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the placement of the floor lamp, which could not be positioned right of the artist table without being out of bounds. To resolve this, the floor lamp was removed from the setup, as it was deemed the least important for the user's preference and the room's functionality. The removal of the floor lamp ensures the room maintains its open layout and adheres to the user's vision of a contemporary art studio with essential elements like the easel, paintbrushes, and stool.
