## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a sleek home gym that accommodates yoga, strength training, and cardio exercises. Essential equipment includes a yoga mat, a set of dumbbells, and a stationary bicycle. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for distinct workout zones. The user emphasizes a minimalist design, avoiding clutter while maintaining functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional zones based on user requirements. The central area is designated for yoga and stretching, featuring a yoga mat. The south wall is allocated for strength training, housing a dumbbell rack. The east wall is reserved for cardio exercises with a stationary bicycle. Additional areas include a storage zone on the south wall for gym accessories and a hydration station on the east wall. A mirror on the west wall enhances visual openness and self-monitoring.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the yoga and stretching area, a blue and white striped yoga mat is recommended, measuring 1.8 meters by 0.6 meters. The strength training area includes a modern metal dumbbell rack, 1.0 meter by 0.5 meter by 1.0 meter, placed against the north wall. The cardio area features a black stationary bicycle, 1.2 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.1 meters, positioned against the east wall. A minimalist black floor mat, 2.0 meters by 1.0 meter, is placed under the dumbbell rack for equipment protection. A modern glass mirror, 1.5 meters by 0.1 meter by 1.8 meters, is mounted on the west wall. A modern white storage cabinet, 1.0 meter by 0.5 meter by 1.5 meters, is placed on the south wall for equipment storage.

## 4. Scene Graph
The yoga mat is placed centrally in the room to provide ample space for movement and exercises, adhering to minimalist principles and maintaining visual symmetry. Its dimensions are 1.8 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.02 meters, and it faces the north wall. This placement ensures no spatial conflicts and aligns with user preferences for a sleek home gym.

The dumbbell rack is positioned against the north wall, facing the south wall, to ensure easy access and maintain an organized layout. Its dimensions are 1.0 meter by 0.5 meter by 1.0 meter. This placement avoids obstruction of the central yoga area and aligns with the user's vision of distinct workout zones.

The stationary bicycle is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, to provide a focused view during workouts. Its dimensions are 1.2 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.1 meters. This placement ensures stability and frees up space in the middle of the room, adhering to design principles of balance and functionality.

The floor mat is placed under the dumbbell rack on the north wall to protect the floor from heavy equipment. Its dimensions are 2.0 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.01 meter. This placement ensures no interference with the yoga mat and maintains the room's sleek aesthetic.

The mirror is mounted on the west wall, facing the east wall, to enhance visual openness and allow self-monitoring during exercises. Its dimensions are 1.5 meters by 0.1 meter by 1.8 meters. This placement complements the gym's aesthetic and functional needs without interfering with other objects.

The storage cabinet is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, to provide accessible equipment storage while maintaining open space in the middle of the room. Its dimensions are 1.0 meter by 0.5 meter by 1.5 meters. This placement ensures balance and proportion, aligning with the user's sleek design preference.

The water dispenser is placed on the east wall, left of the stationary bicycle, facing the west wall. Its dimensions are 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.2 meters. This placement ensures easy access during workouts and integrates seamlessly into the gym's layout without disturbing existing setups.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose regarding the placement of the exercise ball, which was intended to be placed right of the yoga mat. The width of the yoga mat was insufficient to accommodate the exercise ball without causing spatial conflicts. To resolve this, the exercise ball was removed from the setup, as it was deemed less critical compared to the other essential equipment specified by the user. This decision maintained the room's functionality and adhered to the user's preference for a sleek home gym.
