## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a contemporary guest room that emphasizes comfort, functionality, and minimalism. The room is to include a daybed, a small writing desk, and a floor-to-ceiling bookshelf. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user prefers a minimalist style with additional elements such as a floor lamp, an area rug, and decorative plants to enhance the room's ambiance. The window is to remain untreated to allow natural light and ventilation, contributing to an airy and comfortable atmosphere.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures: the Daybed Area, designed for both seating and sleeping; the Writing Desk Area, providing a workspace for guests; and the Bookshelf Area, offering accessible and visually pleasing book storage. Additional substructures include the Lighting Area, enhancing ambiance with a floor lamp, and the Decorative Area, featuring plants to maintain a minimalist aesthetic.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Daybed Area, a contemporary fabric daybed in light gray is recommended, accompanied by a dark blue cushion for comfort. The Writing Desk Area includes a small, modern white desk with a comfortable black metal chair and a silver desk lamp for additional lighting. The Bookshelf Area features a dark brown, floor-to-ceiling wooden bookshelf with a metal ladder for accessibility. A black metal floor lamp is suggested for the Lighting Area, while a beige wool area rug and a green ceramic decorative plant are recommended to enhance the room's aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The daybed, a central element for seating and sleeping, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions are 2.0 meters in length, 0.9 meters in width, and 0.5 meters in height. This placement maximizes space and functionality, allowing the daybed to serve as both a seating and sleeping area while maintaining a contemporary aesthetic. The cushion, measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.15 meters, is placed on the daybed to enhance comfort and add a pop of color, aligning with the room's style.

The writing desk, essential for providing a workspace, is positioned against the east wall, facing the north wall. It measures 1.446 meters in length, 0.741 meters in width, and 0.844 meters in height. This placement ensures the desk is accessible and functional, complementing the daybed and maintaining room balance. The desk chair, measuring 0.663 meters by 0.683 meters by 0.986 meters, is placed behind the desk, facing the same direction to facilitate ease of use.

The desk lamp, with dimensions of 0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters, is placed on the writing desk to provide task lighting without cluttering the workspace. The bookshelf, measuring 1.5 meters by 0.3 meters by 2.5 meters, is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall, ensuring easy access and maintaining visual balance in the room. The ladder, 2.0 meters in height, is placed adjacent to the bookshelf to facilitate access to higher shelves.

The floor lamp, measuring 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.5 meters, is placed adjacent to the daybed on the south wall, providing ambient lighting without interfering with other elements. The area rug, measuring 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters, is placed in the middle of the room, tying the space together and enhancing comfort. The decorative plant, measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter, is placed in the corner where the south wall meets the west wall, adding a touch of greenery without obstructing movement.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to the limited space on the daybed for multiple accessories. Specifically, the daybed could not accommodate both cushions and the throw blanket without spatial conflicts. To resolve this, the throw blanket was removed, prioritizing the cushions for their functional and aesthetic contributions to the room. This adjustment ensures the room remains uncluttered and adheres to the user's minimalist preferences.
