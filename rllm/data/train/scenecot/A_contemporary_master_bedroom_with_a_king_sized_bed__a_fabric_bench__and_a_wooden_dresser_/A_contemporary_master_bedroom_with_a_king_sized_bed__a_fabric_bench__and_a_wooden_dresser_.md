## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a contemporary master bedroom featuring a king-sized bed, a fabric bench, and a wooden dresser. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for these furnishings. The user emphasizes a contemporary style with a neutral color palette, aiming for a harmonious and functional layout. Additional elements such as bedside tables, lamps, a rug, and a ceiling light are suggested to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three primary substructures: the Sleeping Area, the Storage Area, and the Seating Area. The Sleeping Area is centered around the king-sized bed, accompanied by bedside tables and lamps for added functionality and style. The Storage Area features the wooden dresser, potentially enhanced by a mirror for visual appeal and utility. The Seating Area includes the fabric bench, with a side table for additional utility. A modern rug in the middle of the room and a ceiling light fixture are proposed to unify the space and provide ambient lighting.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sleeping Area, a contemporary king-sized bed with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.8 meters by 0.6 meters is recommended, along with two bedside tables (0.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.5 meters) and matching lamps (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters). The Storage Area features a wooden dresser (1.2 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.8 meters) with a mirror (1.0 meter by 0.05 meter by 0.8 meter) above it. The Seating Area includes a fabric bench (1.2 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.45 meters) and a side table (0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.5 meters). A grey rug (2.0 meters by 1.5 meters) and a chrome ceiling light (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.3 meters) complete the room's contemporary aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The king-sized bed is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, to serve as the room's focal point. This central placement allows for easy access on both sides, accommodating bedside tables and ensuring a balanced layout. The bed's dimensions (2.0m x 1.8m x 0.6m) fit comfortably within the room, maintaining a clear flow and adhering to contemporary design principles.

The first bedside table is positioned to the left of the bed, on the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures symmetry and provides easy access to items while maintaining the room's contemporary style. The table's dimensions (0.5m x 0.4m x 0.5m) allow it to fit snugly beside the bed without spatial conflicts.

The second bedside table is placed to the right of the bed, also on the north wall, facing the south wall. This symmetrical arrangement complements the first bedside table, enhancing the room's balance and functionality. The table's dimensions (0.5m x 0.4m x 0.5m) ensure it fits comfortably in the available space.

Lamp 1 is placed on the right bedside table, providing lighting for the bed area. Its small base (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) fits well on the table, ensuring no spatial conflicts while enhancing the room's contemporary design and functionality.

Lamp 2 is placed on the left bedside table, mirroring Lamp 1 to maintain symmetry and provide balanced lighting. Its dimensions (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) ensure it fits comfortably on the table, complementing the room's aesthetic.

The fabric bench is positioned at the foot of the bed, facing the south wall. This placement provides additional seating without obstructing movement, aligning with the bed's orientation and maintaining the room's symmetry. The bench's dimensions (1.2m x 0.5m x 0.45m) ensure it fits well in front of the bed.

The side table is placed adjacent to the fabric bench, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.5m) allow it to serve as a functional surface for items, complementing the bench and maintaining the room's contemporary aesthetic.

The wooden dresser is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. This location provides storage without overcrowding the space, and its dimensions (1.2m x 0.5m x 0.8m) ensure it fits comfortably along the wall, enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic.

The mirror is mounted above the wooden dresser on the east wall, facing the west wall. Its slim profile (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.8m) ensures it does not protrude significantly, complementing the dresser's functionality and the room's contemporary style.

The rug is placed in the middle of the room, under the fabric bench and in front of the bed. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m) allow it to enhance the room's aesthetic appeal without obstructing movement, aligning with the user's preference for a contemporary design.

The ceiling light is centered in the room, attached to the ceiling. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.3m) ensure it provides even illumination across the space, enhancing the room's ambiance and complementing the contemporary aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
There are no conflicts detected in the room layout, as all objects are placed without overlapping or obstructing each other. The arrangement adheres to the user's preferences and design principles, ensuring a harmonious and functional contemporary master bedroom.
