## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a nautical-themed bathroom, emphasizing elements such as a ceramic pedestal sink, a round mirror, and a rope basket. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The aesthetic focus is on maritime colors and materials, with a preference for functional and decorative elements that enhance the nautical theme. The user also expressed interest in additional objects like a bath mat, towel rack, shelving, and decorative items to complete the room's functionality and visual appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to align with the user's nautical theme. The Sink Area includes the ceramic pedestal sink and associated grooming accessories. The Storage Area features the rope basket for storing bathroom essentials. The Grooming Area is enhanced by the round mirror placed above the sink. The Lighting Area is defined by a ceiling light fixture to provide adequate illumination. Additionally, a Towel Area is designated for the towel rack, and a Comfort Area is created with a bath mat for floor comfort.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sink Area, a white ceramic pedestal sink is recommended, complemented by a nautical-style round mirror. The Storage Area includes a rope basket made of rope material, while the Lighting Area features a nautical-themed white metal ceiling light fixture. The Towel Area is equipped with a silver metal towel rack, and the Comfort Area includes a blue cotton bath mat. A white ceramic soap dispenser is suggested for the Sink Area to enhance functionality, and decorative elements like seashells and a lighthouse figurine are considered to reinforce the nautical theme.

## 4. Scene Graph
The ceramic pedestal sink is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, to allow for plumbing connections and easy access. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.45m x 0.9m) fit comfortably, ensuring it stands out against the blue nautical theme. The round mirror, measuring 0.6m x 0.02m x 0.6m, is positioned above the sink on the north wall, providing a functional grooming area while enhancing the room's aesthetics. The rope basket, with dimensions of 0.4m x 0.4m x 0.3m, is placed on the floor to the right of the sink, offering accessible storage without spatial conflicts. The ceiling light fixture, centrally located on the ceiling, ensures even illumination across the room, with dimensions of 0.447m x 0.441m x 0.876m. The towel rack is mounted on the east wall, 1.2 meters from the floor, facing the west wall, providing convenient access for towels. The bath mat, measuring 1.0m x 0.6m x 0.01m, is placed in front of the sink, enhancing comfort and aligning with the nautical theme. The soap dispenser, small in size (0.1m x 0.1m x 0.15m), is placed on the sink, ensuring easy access and maintaining a cohesive look.

## 5. Global Check
Conflicts arose due to the limited space on the ceramic pedestal sink, which could not accommodate both the decorative seashells and the soap dispenser. Additionally, the space to the right of the sink was insufficient for both the rope basket and the hand towel ring. To resolve these conflicts, the decorative seashells and lighthouse figurine were removed, as they were less critical to the room's functionality compared to the soap dispenser. The hand towel ring was also removed to prioritize the rope basket's storage functionality, ensuring the room remains functional and aesthetically aligned with the user's nautical theme.
