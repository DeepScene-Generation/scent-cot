## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a home office that combines functionality with a minimalistic aesthetic. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a natural wood work table, a black ergonomic office chair, and a gray metal filing cabinet. The user emphasizes the need for document storage, comfortable seating, and adequate desk space, all while maintaining an organized and uncluttered appearance. Additional recommendations include a desk lamp for improved lighting, a plant for ambiance, and a wall clock for time management.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into specific functional areas: the Filing Cabinet Area for document storage, the Seating Area for comfortable work seating, the Work Table Area for primary work activities, and an Open Middle Area to ensure spaciousness and ease of movement. Each area is designed to enhance the room's functionality and maintain a minimalistic aesthetic.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Work Table Area, a natural wood work table is recommended, measuring 1.5 meters by 0.75 meters by 0.75 meters. The Seating Area features a black ergonomic office chair with dimensions of 0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.2 meters. The Filing Cabinet Area includes a gray metal filing cabinet, measuring 0.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.2 meters. Additional objects include a modern metal desk lamp (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters) for the Work Table Area, a minimalist plant (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.6 meters) for ambiance, and a classic white wall clock (0.3 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.3 meters) for time management.

## 4. Scene Graph
The work table is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, as it is the central feature of the home office. This placement maximizes space and creates an efficient workspace, aligning with the user's preference for a natural wood aesthetic. The table's dimensions (1.5m x 0.75m x 0.75m) ensure it fits comfortably against the wall, providing a clear line of sight across the room, which is beneficial for a work environment.

The office chair is positioned directly in front of the work table, facing the south wall. This placement facilitates functional use of the work table, ensuring easy access and comfort. The chair's dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 1.2m) allow it to fit without obstructing movement, complementing the room's design and enhancing its functional appeal.

The filing cabinet is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. This location ensures easy access from the work table, enhancing practicality. The cabinet's dimensions (0.5m x 0.4m x 1.2m) allow it to fit alongside the work table without taking up excessive space, adding variety to the room's design with its industrial style and gray color.

The desk lamp is placed on the work table, towards the corner, to provide optimal lighting without obstructing the workspace. Its dimensions (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) ensure it fits comfortably on the table, enhancing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The plant is positioned on the west wall, right of the filing cabinet, facing the east wall. This placement adds aesthetic value without obstructing functionality, complementing the natural wood theme and contributing to a pleasant work environment. The plant's dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) ensure it fits comfortably next to the filing cabinet.

The wall clock is centrally placed on the south wall above the work table, facing the north wall. This placement ensures visibility from the office chair and throughout the room, enhancing functionality and maintaining aesthetic balance. The clock's dimensions (0.3m x 0.05m x 0.3m) allow it to fit without taking up much space, adhering to design principles.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed in a manner that respects the user's preferences and the room's functional and aesthetic requirements. The layout ensures a balanced and organized home office environment, with each object contributing to the overall design without causing spatial conflicts.
