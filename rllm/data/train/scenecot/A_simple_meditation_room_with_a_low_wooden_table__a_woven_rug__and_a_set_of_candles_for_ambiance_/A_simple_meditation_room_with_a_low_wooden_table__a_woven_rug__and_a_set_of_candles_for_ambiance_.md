## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a meditation room characterized by simplicity and tranquility, with essential elements including a low wooden table, a woven rug, and a set of candles. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for movement and relaxation. The user emphasizes a minimalist aesthetic, seeking a clutter-free environment that supports meditation and relaxation. Additional items such as meditation cushions, a small shelf for organizing accessories, a floor lamp for ambient lighting, and a small plant to introduce a natural element are considered to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to fulfill its function as a meditation space. The Meditation Zone is the central area where the wooden table and woven rug are placed, serving as the focal point for meditation practices. The Candle Arrangement is designed to enhance ambient lighting and tranquility. The Floor Seating Area includes meditation cushions for comfort, while the Storage Area, represented by a small shelf, organizes meditation accessories. The Lighting Area, featuring a floor lamp, provides additional ambient lighting, and the Decorative Area, with a small plant, adds a natural touch to the room.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Meditation Zone, a minimalist wooden table (1.0m x 0.5m x 0.4m) is recommended to support candles and decor. A bohemian-style woven rug (2.0m x 2.0m) is suggested for floor seating. The Candle Arrangement includes minimalist white candles (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.15m) for ambient lighting. The Floor Seating Area features zen-style meditation cushions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m) for comfort. A minimalist wooden shelf (0.8m x 0.3m x 1.0m) is proposed for the Storage Area to organize accessories. The Lighting Area includes a modern metal floor lamp (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.5m) for additional lighting. Finally, a bohemian-style plant (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.6m) is recommended for the Decorative Area to enhance the room's natural ambiance.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden table is placed centrally in the room, serving as the focal point of the meditation zone. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.5m x 0.4m) allow it to support candles and decor, aligning with the user's preference for a minimalist and balanced space. The table's central placement ensures it remains accessible and enhances the room's ambiance without cluttering the edges.

The woven rug is positioned under the wooden table, creating a cohesive and functional seating area. With dimensions of 2.0m x 2.0m, the rug provides a comfortable area for meditation practices, maintaining balance and proportion in the room's design. This arrangement supports the user's preference for simplicity and an open, airy atmosphere.

Candles are placed on the wooden table, enhancing the room's tranquility with ambient lighting. Their placement on the table ensures they are a focal point, contributing to the minimalist style and maintaining balance without cluttering the space. The candles' dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.15m) allow them to fit comfortably on the table.

Meditation cushions are placed on the woven rug, providing comfortable seating for meditation. The first cushion is positioned in front of the wooden table, while the second cushion is placed next to the first, creating a balanced and inviting arrangement. Each cushion measures 0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m, fitting well within the rug's dimensions and maintaining the room's aesthetic.

The floor lamp is placed against the south wall, providing additional lighting without disrupting the room's minimal and calming atmosphere. Its height of 1.5 meters allows it to illuminate the room effectively, complementing the existing arrangement and enhancing the room's ambiance.

The shelf is positioned against the east wall, providing easy access for organizing meditation accessories. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.3m x 1.0m) ensure it fits well against the wall without overwhelming the space, maintaining balance and proportion in the room's layout.

Finally, the plant is placed in the north-west corner of the room, serving as a decorative element that enhances the room's natural ambiance. Its placement ensures it is visible from most angles in the room, contributing to the room's peaceful atmosphere without obstructing pathways or the function of other objects.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The arrangement of objects in the room adheres to the user's preferences for a simple and serene meditation space, maintaining balance and proportion while ensuring functionality and aesthetic appeal.
