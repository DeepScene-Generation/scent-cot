## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern craft room that emphasizes functionality for crafting activities. Key elements include a large wooden table, fabric storage bins, and a sewing machine. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters. The user prioritizes a minimalist aesthetic with organized storage and efficient lighting. The crafting table is central to the room's functionality, providing a large surface for cutting and assembling fabrics. The sewing machine setup should ensure ergonomic use and be easily reachable from the crafting table. Natural lighting is crucial for crafting, particularly for detailed work, and a spacious design enhances the room's usability. Additional objects like a comfortable chair, task lighting, and organizational tools are considered to optimize functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The central Crafting Area is designated for the crafting table, which serves as the main workspace. The Storage Area, located along the south wall, is intended for fabric storage bins and a thread rack, ensuring materials are organized and easily accessible. The Lighting Area focuses on providing adequate illumination for detailed crafting work, with a task lamp positioned on the crafting table. The Seating Area is designed for comfort and functionality, with a task chair placed in front of the crafting table to facilitate crafting activities.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Crafting Area, a modern-style wooden crafting table with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended. The Storage Area features modern fabric storage bins measuring 1.2 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.5 meters, and a wooden thread rack measuring 0.4 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.6 meters. The Lighting Area includes a modern metal task lamp with dimensions of 0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters. The Seating Area is equipped with a modern metal task chair measuring 0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.0 meters. Additional tools such as a sewing machine (0.5 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.4 meters), a cutting mat (1.0 meters by 0.7 meters by 0.02 meters), and scissors (0.03 meters by 0.159 meters by 0.018 meters) are recommended for the Crafting Area to enhance functionality.

## 4. Scene Graph
The crafting table is the central piece of the room, essential for cutting and assembling fabrics. It is placed in the middle of the room, facing the north wall, to allow access from all sides, which is ideal for crafting activities. The table's dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.75m) ensure ample space for movement and functionality, adhering to modern design principles of balance and proportion.

The sewing machine is placed on the crafting table, facing the north wall. This placement ensures easy access and use while seated at the table, maintaining the room's modern and functional theme. The sewing machine's dimensions (0.5m x 0.3m x 0.4m) fit comfortably on the table without causing spatial conflicts.

The storage bins are positioned against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures easy access to fabrics while crafting and maximizes room space. The bins' dimensions (1.2m x 0.4m x 1.5m) allow them to fit against the wall without interfering with the crafting table's functionality.

The task chair is placed in front of the crafting table, facing the south wall. This placement ensures the chair is adjacent to the table, providing optimal seating for crafting activities. The chair's dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing pathways.

The task lamp is positioned on the crafting table, facing the north wall. This placement provides direct illumination for crafting activities, enhancing the workspace's lighting. The lamp's compact size (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) ensures it does not clutter the table.

The cutting mat is placed directly on the crafting table, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.7m x 0.02m) ensure it fits comfortably alongside the sewing machine, providing a protective surface for crafting activities.

The scissors are placed on the crafting table, adjacent to the cutting mat, facing the north wall. This placement ensures they are within easy reach during crafting activities without creating spatial conflicts.

The thread rack is placed on the south wall, adjacent to the storage bins, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.1m x 0.6m) allow it to fit beside the bins, maintaining an organized appearance and ensuring easy access to threads.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The arrangement of objects in the room adheres to the user's vision for a modern craft room, ensuring functionality and aesthetic appeal without any spatial conflicts.

        - conclusion: Using length dimension for directional constraint
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'right of' relation
        - calculation:
            - thread_rack_1 size: 0.4 (length)
            - Cluster size (right of): max(0.0, 0.4) = 0.4
        - conclusion: thread_rack_1 cluster size (right of): 0.4
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'south_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - thread_rack_1 size: length=0.4, width=0.1, height=0.6
            - Room size: 5.0x5.0x3.0
            - x_min = 2.5 + -1 * 5.0/2 + 1 * 0.4/2 = 0.2
            - x_max = 2.5 + 1 * 5.0/2 + -1 * 0.4/2 = 4.8
            - y_min = y_max = 0.05
            - z_min = z_max = 0.6/2 = 0.3
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.2, 4.8, 0.05, 0.05, 0.3, 0.3)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.2-4.8), y(0.05-0.05)
            - Final coordinates: x=4.3093, y=0.05, z=0.3
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 4.3093, y: 0.05, z: 0.3
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No other objects in the vicinity
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Final coordinates: x=4.3093, y=0.05, z=0.3
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 4.3093, y: 0.05, z: 0.3
