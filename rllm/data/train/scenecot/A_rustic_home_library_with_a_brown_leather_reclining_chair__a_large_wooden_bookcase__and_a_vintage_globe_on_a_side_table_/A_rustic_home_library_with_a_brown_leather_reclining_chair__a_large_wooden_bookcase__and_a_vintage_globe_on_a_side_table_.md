## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a rustic home library designed for reading and relaxation, emphasizing a cozy and traditional aesthetic. Essential elements include a large wooden bookcase, a brown leather reclining chair, a vintage globe on a side table, and adequate lighting. The room's dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user prefers a rustic style, with wood and leather as primary materials, and desires a functional yet aesthetically pleasing arrangement that does not exceed 12 items.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Bookcase Area is designated for a large wooden bookcase to serve as a focal point and provide ample storage for books. The Reclining Chair Area is intended for a comfortable brown leather chair, creating a cozy reading spot. The Side Table Area, featuring a vintage globe, serves as a decorative and functional element. The Lighting Area focuses on providing adequate illumination with a rustic floor lamp. Additional substructures include a Wall Bookshelf Area for extra storage and an Area Rug Zone to enhance comfort and aesthetics.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Bookcase Area, a solid wood bookcase with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 0.4 meters by 2.2 meters is recommended to fulfill both functional and aesthetic needs. In the Reclining Chair Area, a classic brown leather reclining chair measuring 1.0 meter by 0.9 meters by 1.0 meter is suggested for comfort and style. The Side Table Area features a rustic wooden side table (0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.5 meters) with a vintage globe (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.4 meters) for decorative purposes. The Lighting Area includes a rustic bronze floor lamp (0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.8 meters) to provide focused lighting. An area rug (3.0 meters by 2.0 meters) is recommended to anchor the furniture and enhance the rustic aesthetic. A wall-mounted bookshelf (1.0 meter by 0.4 meters by 2.0 meters) offers additional storage, while vintage metal bookends (0.15 meters by 0.15 meters by 0.2 meters) are suggested for organizing books.

## 4. Scene Graph
The large wooden bookcase is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall, serving as the room's focal point. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.4m x 2.2m) require wall support, and its placement ensures accessibility and visual prominence, aligning with the rustic library theme. The reclining chair is positioned in the middle of the room, facing the south wall, adjacent to the bookcase. This placement allows easy access to books and maintains balance and proportion, enhancing the room's functionality as a reading area. The side table is placed to the left of the reclining chair, facing the east wall, with the vintage globe on it. This arrangement ensures accessibility and complements the rustic aesthetic. The floor lamp is positioned to the right of the reclining chair, facing the south wall, providing focused lighting for reading. The area rug is placed in the middle of the room, under the reclining chair, side table, and floor lamp, tying the space together and enhancing comfort. The wall bookshelf is mounted on the south wall, facing the north wall, providing additional storage and visual balance. Bookends are placed on the bookcase, organizing books and maintaining the rustic theme.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the placement of the decorative throw on the reclining chair, as the chair's area was too small to accommodate all objects. To resolve this, the decorative throw was removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a rustic home library with essential elements like the reclining chair, bookcase, and vintage globe. This adjustment ensures the room's functionality and aesthetic remain intact.
