## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a contemporary master bedroom characterized by a minimalist and modern aesthetic. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, is designed to accommodate a king-sized platform bed, a sleek dresser, and a cozy reading chair. The emphasis is on comfort, functionality, and visual harmony, with the room's layout ensuring an open and airy feel. The user desires a luxurious atmosphere with essential furniture pieces strategically placed to maintain balance and accessibility.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into specific functional areas based on the user's requirements. The king-sized platform bed area is positioned against the north wall, serving as the room's focal point. The sleek dresser area is located against the east wall, providing storage while maintaining accessibility. The cozy reading chair corner is situated in the south-west corner, offering a dedicated space for relaxation. The middle of the room remains open to facilitate easy movement and enhance the room's spaciousness.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the king-sized platform bed area, a contemporary-style bed with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 2.0 meters by 0.5 meters is recommended. The sleek dresser, measuring 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.9 meters, is suggested for the dresser area. A cozy reading chair with dimensions of 0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 1.0 meter is proposed for the reading corner. Additional recommendations include two bedside tables (0.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.5 meters each) with table lamps for lighting, and a modern wool rug (2.5 meters by 1.5 meters) to enhance comfort and aesthetic appeal.

## 4. Scene Graph
The king-sized platform bed is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures the bed is the focal point of the room, aligning with the user's contemporary style preference and optimizing space usage. The bed's dimensions (2.0m x 2.0m x 0.5m) allow it to be accessible from both sides, maintaining functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The dresser is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This location optimizes space and maintains accessibility, complementing the contemporary style. The dresser's dimensions (1.5m x 0.5m x 0.9m) fit comfortably against the wall, ensuring balance and avoiding overcrowding the north wall where the bed is placed.

The reading chair is positioned in the south-west corner, facing the east wall. This placement creates a cozy reading nook, enhancing the room's functionality and maintaining a welcoming atmosphere. The chair's dimensions (0.8m x 0.8m x 1.0m) ensure it does not conflict with other furniture, adhering to the contemporary theme.

The first bedside table is placed to the left of the king bed, on the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.4m x 0.5m) ensure it fits comfortably next to the bed, providing functionality without obstructing pathways. The second bedside table is placed to the right of the bed, maintaining symmetry and balance in the room.

Table lamp 1 is placed on bedside table 1, providing convenient lighting for reading. Its small size (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.4m) ensures it does not overcrowd the table. Table lamp 2 is placed on bedside table 2, maintaining symmetry and providing balanced lighting on both sides of the bed.

The rug is placed in the middle of the room, parallel to the room's layout. Its dimensions (2.5m x 1.5m) fit well within the open floor space, complementing the existing furniture arrangement and enhancing the room's aesthetic and functional appeal.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The arrangement of objects ensures optimal use of space, maintaining the room's contemporary aesthetic and functionality. All objects are placed without spatial conflicts, adhering to the user's preferences and design principles.
