## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a cozy reading nook within a 5.0m x 5.0m room, emphasizing comfort and functionality. Key elements include a soft armchair, a wooden side table, and a tall floor lamp, all positioned against the south wall. The user desires a space that promotes relaxation, with accessible storage for books and beverages, and adjustable lighting. Additional elements such as a bookcase, rug, cushions, and a small plant are considered to enhance the nook's functionality and aesthetic appeal, maintaining a harmonious and inviting atmosphere.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into specific areas to accommodate the reading nook. The south wall is designated for the primary setup, including the armchair, side table, and floor lamp, creating a cozy and enclosed space. The middle of the room is reserved for the rug, anchoring the seating arrangement and adding warmth. The layout ensures that all elements complement each other in style and functionality, with additional decorative elements enhancing the overall aesthetic.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the reading nook, a cozy fabric armchair in warm beige is recommended for comfortable seating. A rustic wooden side table in dark brown provides a surface for books and beverages. A modern black metal floor lamp offers adjustable lighting. A bohemian multicolor rug adds warmth and defines the seating area. A modern light blue cushion enhances comfort on the armchair. A small green plant in a ceramic pot adds a touch of nature and freshness to the space. These objects collectively create a complete and inviting reading nook.

## 4. Scene Graph
The armchair, a central piece of the reading nook, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions are 1.0m x 0.9m x 1.0m, ensuring it fits comfortably without spatial conflicts. This placement utilizes the room's layout efficiently, creating a comfortable space for reading and maintaining balance and symmetry.

The side table, measuring 0.6m x 0.4m x 0.5m, is positioned to the right of the armchair, facing the north wall. This placement ensures easy access for holding books and beverages, aligning with user preferences and maintaining a balanced composition.

The floor lamp, with dimensions of 0.601m x 0.601m x 1.902m, is placed to the left of the armchair on the south wall, facing the north wall. This location provides ample lighting to the armchair and side table without obstructing movement, complementing the cozy reading nook.

The rug, measuring 2.0m x 1.5m x 0.02m, is placed on the floor in the middle of the room, in front of the armchair. This placement creates a defined area for the reading nook, enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal and ensuring it does not interfere with existing furniture.

The cushion, sized at 0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m, is placed on the armchair, adding comfort and a pop of color. This placement aligns with the user's vision of a cozy reading nook, enhancing the overall atmosphere.

The plant, with dimensions of 0.3m x 0.3m x 0.8m, is placed on the side table, positioned on the south wall to the right of the armchair. This placement integrates the plant into the existing setup, enhancing aesthetic appeal without disrupting functionality.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited length of the south wall, which could not accommodate all intended objects. The bookcase was identified as the least critical element for the user's preference and room functionality. To resolve this, the bookcase was removed, ensuring the primary elements of the cozy reading nook—armchair, side table, and floor lamp—remain intact, aligning with the user's vision and maintaining the room's functionality.
