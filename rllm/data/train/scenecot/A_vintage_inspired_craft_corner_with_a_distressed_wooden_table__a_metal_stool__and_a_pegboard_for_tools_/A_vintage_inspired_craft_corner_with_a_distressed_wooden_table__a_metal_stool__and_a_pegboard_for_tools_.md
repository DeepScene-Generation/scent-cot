## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a vintage-inspired craft corner within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary elements include a distressed wooden table, a metal stool, and a pegboard for tool organization. The user emphasizes the need for vintage aesthetics, ergonomic seating, tool accessibility, and appropriate lighting. Additional preferences include a vintage lamp for ambiance, a craft storage unit for materials, and a vintage-inspired rug to define the craft corner.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to accommodate the user's requirements. The Crafting Area is centered around the distressed wooden table and metal stool, providing a workspace for crafting activities. The Tool Organization Area features a pegboard on the south wall for easy access to tools. The Lighting Area includes a vintage lamp to enhance the ambiance and provide necessary lighting. The Storage Area, located on the west wall, is designated for storing crafting materials. Lastly, the Aesthetic Enhancement Area is defined by a vintage rug and artwork to complement the overall vintage theme.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Crafting Area, a distressed wooden table (1.5m x 0.8m x 0.75m) and a metal stool (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.6m) are recommended to provide a functional and ergonomic workspace. The Tool Organization Area includes a pegboard (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.0m) for organizing tools. The Lighting Area features a vintage brass lamp (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.0m) to illuminate the workspace. The Storage Area is equipped with a rustic wooden storage unit (1.0m x 0.5m x 1.2m) for material storage. A vintage-patterned rug (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.01m) and vintage artwork (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.0m) are recommended to enhance the aesthetic appeal of the craft corner.

## 4. Scene Graph
The distressed wooden table is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, serving as the central piece for crafting activities. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.8m x 0.75m) allow it to fit comfortably, providing ample space for the stool and ensuring the pegboard can be mounted above it. This placement aligns with the user's vision for a vintage craft corner and adheres to design principles of balance and proportion.

The metal stool is positioned in front of the table, facing the south wall, to provide ergonomic seating for crafting activities. Its compact dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.6m) ensure it fits comfortably without overlapping with other objects. This placement maintains the vintage craft corner's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The pegboard is mounted on the south wall, facing the north wall, to provide convenient tool access. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.0m) allow it to fit without spatial conflicts, aligning with the user's preference for a vintage-inspired craft corner.

The vintage lamp is placed on the north wall, next to the table, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.0m) ensure it does not obstruct the workspace or seating area. This placement provides necessary lighting for crafting and enhances the vintage aesthetic.

The vintage-patterned rug is placed on the floor, under the table and stool, defining the craft corner. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.01m) allow it to accommodate the table and stool, enhancing the visual boundaries of the craft corner.

The rustic storage unit is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.5m x 1.2m) ensure it does not interfere with the current layout, providing accessible storage while maintaining the room's flow and vintage theme.

The vintage artwork is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.0m) ensure it does not interfere with functional elements, adding visual interest and complementing the vintage theme.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the pegboard's width being too small to accommodate the tool holder adjacent to it. To resolve this, the tool holder was removed, as it was deemed less critical compared to the pegboard, which is essential for tool organization in the vintage-inspired craft corner. This decision aligns with the user's preference for a functional and aesthetically pleasing workspace.
