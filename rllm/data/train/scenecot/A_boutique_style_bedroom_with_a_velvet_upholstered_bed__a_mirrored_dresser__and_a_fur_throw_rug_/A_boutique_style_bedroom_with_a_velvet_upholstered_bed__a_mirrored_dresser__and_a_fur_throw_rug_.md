## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a boutique-style bedroom that features a velvet upholstered bed, a mirrored dresser, and a fur throw rug. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user's preferences emphasize a luxurious and opulent aesthetic, with specific placements suggested for the south wall, west wall, and the middle of the room. Additional elements such as a bedside table, lamp, decorative chair, and plant are considered to enhance functionality and aesthetic appeal, while maintaining a balance between style and usability.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to accommodate the user's requirements. The Sleeping Area is centered around the south wall, where the velvet upholstered bed serves as the focal point. The Storage Area is designated along the east wall for the mirrored dresser, providing both storage and a reflective surface to enhance the room's sense of space. The Comfort Area is located in the middle of the room, where the fur throw rug adds warmth and texture. Additional substructures include the Bedside Area for functional items like a table and lamp, and the Decorative Area near the dresser for aesthetic enhancements like a chair and plant.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sleeping Area, a navy blue velvet upholstered bed measuring 2.0 meters by 1.8 meters by 1.2 meters is recommended. The Storage Area features a silver mirrored dresser with dimensions of 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter. In the Comfort Area, a white fur throw rug measuring 1.543 meters by 1.059 meters is suggested. The Bedside Area includes a dark brown wooden bedside table (0.6 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.6 meters) and a lamp, while the Decorative Area features a modern emerald green velvet chair and a green ceramic plant, both complementing the boutique style.

## 4. Scene Graph
The velvet upholstered bed is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, as it is the focal point of the room. This placement maximizes space and functionality, allowing easy access from both sides and aligning with the user's boutique-style preference. The bed's dimensions (2.0m x 1.8m x 1.2m) fit comfortably against the wall, ensuring balance and proportion within the room.

The mirrored dresser is positioned on the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement provides stability and accessibility, enhancing the room's aesthetic by reflecting light and creating a sense of space. The dresser's dimensions (1.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably along the wall without spatial conflicts, complementing the bed and maintaining visual harmony.

The fur throw rug is placed in the middle of the room, directly in front of the upholstered bed. This central placement allows the rug to anchor the room, providing a soft surface underfoot and enhancing the room's luxurious theme. The rug's dimensions (1.543m x 1.059m) ensure it fits comfortably without overlapping other objects.

The bedside table is placed on the right side of the upholstered bed, facing the north wall. This placement ensures easy access from the bed, maintaining balance and proportion with other objects. The table's dimensions (0.6m x 0.4m x 0.6m) allow it to fit comfortably alongside the bed without obstructing other elements.

The artwork is mounted on the south wall above the upholstered bed, facing the north wall. This placement creates a focal point in the room, enhancing the boutique style and drawing attention to the bed area. The artwork's dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.0m) ensure it fits well above the bed without spatial conflicts.

The plant is placed on the floor next to the mirrored dresser, facing the west wall. This placement enhances the aesthetic value of the dresser area without obstructing functionality. The plant's dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably next to the dresser, complementing the room's boutique style.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts were identified with the bedside table and mirrored dresser. The bedside table was too small to accommodate both the lamp and other items, leading to the decision to remove the lamp based on its lower priority compared to the table's functionality. Additionally, the mirrored dresser's width was insufficient to accommodate both the decorative chair and plant. The decorative chair was removed to maintain the room's functionality and aesthetic, as the plant provided a more significant decorative impact.
