## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern kitchen featuring essential elements such as a stainless steel refrigerator, an oven, a ceramic worktop, and blue wooden cabinets. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes a modern aesthetic, prioritizing functionality and style. Additional elements like a sink, bar stools, a trash bin, and a lighting fixture are considered beneficial for enhancing the kitchen's usability and visual appeal. The design aims to maintain an open movement space for safety and efficiency.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The kitchen is divided into several functional substructures: the Refrigerator Space on the west wall for food storage, the Oven Area adjacent to the refrigerator for cooking, the Worktop Area on the south wall for meal preparation, and the Cabinet Storage Area for organizing kitchen essentials. The Open Movement Space in the center ensures safe and efficient navigation, while the Lighting Area on the ceiling provides ambient illumination.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Refrigerator Space, a modern stainless steel refrigerator is recommended, measuring 0.8 meters by 0.7 meters by 1.8 meters. The Oven Area features a stainless steel oven with dimensions of 0.6 meters by 0.673 meters by 0.948 meters. The Worktop Area includes a ceramic worktop, complemented by blue wooden cabinets for storage. A modern metal lighting fixture is suggested for the ceiling to enhance visibility. Bar stools and a trash bin are proposed for the Worktop Area to facilitate casual dining and waste management.

## 4. Scene Graph
The refrigerator is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall, to maximize open space and ensure ergonomic access. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.7m x 1.8m) make it a prominent feature, aligning with the modern aesthetic and providing balance and proportion to the space. The placement supports functionality by keeping the refrigerator accessible and visually appealing.

The oven is positioned on the west wall, adjacent to the refrigerator, facing the east wall. This placement creates a functional cooking zone, enhancing aesthetic coherence with the refrigerator. The oven's dimensions (0.6m x 0.673m x 0.948m) allow it to fit comfortably beside the refrigerator, maintaining balance and functionality.

The lighting fixture is centrally placed on the ceiling to provide even illumination throughout the room. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m) and modern style complement the kitchen's aesthetic, ensuring no spatial conflicts and adhering to design principles for balanced lighting distribution.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the placement of cabinet_1, initially intended to be left of the worktop_1, as the oven_1 occupied that space. The cabinet was repositioned to the right of the worktop_1, maintaining adjacency and functionality. Further conflicts were identified due to the limited space on the south wall, necessitating the deletion of cabinet_2 and trash_bin_1 to accommodate the remaining elements. This resolution prioritized the user's preference for a modern kitchen with essential appliances and storage, ensuring a functional and aesthetically pleasing layout.
