## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a chic dressing room that includes essential items such as a vanity table, a full-length mirror, and a stool. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, serves as a backdrop for these items. The primary focus is on creating a stylish and functional vanity area, complete with a modern lamp for adequate lighting. The full-length mirror is crucial for outfit assessment, and additional elements like storage solutions, decorative items, and a rug are considered to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetics. The overall design aims to maintain elegance and a cohesive visual flow.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures based on the user's requirements. The Vanity Area is the focal point, featuring a stylish vanity table and ergonomic stool for makeup application. The Mirror Area, located on the east wall, is dedicated to outfit assessment with a full-length mirror. The Storage Area on the south wall provides space for organizing accessories. The Decorative Area includes elements like a chic rug and artwork to enhance the room's aesthetic appeal. Each substructure is designed to contribute to the room's elegance and functionality.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Vanity Area, a chic wooden vanity table (1.2m x 0.5m x 0.8m) and a beige fabric stool (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.45m) are recommended. A modern metal lamp (0.453m x 0.367m x 0.122m) is suggested for lighting. The Mirror Area features an elegant glass full-length mirror (0.8m x 0.05m x 1.8m) for outfit assessment. In the Storage Area, a modern white wooden shelf (1.0m x 0.3m x 1.5m) is proposed for organizing accessories. The Decorative Area includes a chic grey rug (2.0m x 2.0m x 0.02m) and modern multicolor canvas artwork (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.0m) to enhance the room's visual appeal.

## 4. Scene Graph
The vanity table is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, to provide a central and accessible location for makeup application. Its chic design aligns with the room's symmetry and ensures adequate space for movement. The stool is positioned in front of the vanity table, facing the south wall, to offer practical seating without obstructing movement. The modern lamp is placed on the vanity table, facing the south wall, to enhance visibility for makeup application. The full-length mirror is mounted on the west wall, facing the east wall, to provide a clear view for outfit assessment without obstruction. The chic grey rug is centrally placed on the floor, underneath the stool and in front of the vanity table, to add warmth and luxury without hindering movement. The storage shelf is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, to provide convenient storage space near the vanity table. The modern artwork is positioned on the west wall, above the full-length mirror, to add a visual focal point without obstructing the mirror's functionality.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the vanity table's surface area being too small to accommodate both the lamp and the decorative vase. To resolve this, the decorative vase was removed, as the lamp is essential for providing adequate lighting in the chic dressing room. This decision aligns with the user's preference for a functional and stylish vanity area, ensuring the room's overall aesthetic and functionality are maintained.
