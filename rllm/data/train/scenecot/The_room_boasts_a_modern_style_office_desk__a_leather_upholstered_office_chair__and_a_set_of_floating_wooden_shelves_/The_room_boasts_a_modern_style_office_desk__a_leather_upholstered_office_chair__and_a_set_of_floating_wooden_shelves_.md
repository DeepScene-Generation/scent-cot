## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a modern office room that incorporates a desk, chair, and shelves, emphasizing workspace functionality and modern aesthetics. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user has specified a preference for a modern style, which should be reflected in the furniture and decor choices. The room should support productivity with functional elements like a desk lamp and a monitor, while also maintaining visual interest with decorative items such as bookends and a potted plant. Ergonomic considerations are important, with a focus on comfort through the inclusion of an ergonomic chair and a footrest. The room should also feature a rug to define the workspace and a floor lamp to balance natural light from the window.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to optimize functionality and aesthetics. The Office Desk Area is the primary workspace, requiring a desk, chair, and task lighting. Floating Shelves are designated for storage and display, adding visual interest. The Middle Open Space is defined by a rug, creating a cohesive workspace area. The Window Area on the north wall provides natural light, complemented by additional lighting solutions like a floor lamp in the corner. Each substructure is designed to maintain a modern style and cohesive color palette, ensuring the room remains functional and visually appealing.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Office Desk Area, a modern white wood desk (1.8m x 0.8m x 0.75m) is recommended, paired with a black leather ergonomic office chair (0.627m x 0.603m x 0.778m) and a silver metal desk lamp (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) for task lighting. A black plastic monitor (0.6m x 0.2m x 0.4m) is suggested for productivity. Floating Shelves in walnut wood (1.2m x 0.3m x 0.2m) are proposed for storage and display, with modern metal bookends (0.2m x 0.1m x 0.2m) and a green ceramic potted plant (0.229m x 0.177m x 0.224m) for decoration. A gray wool rug (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.01m) defines the Middle Open Space, while a black metal floor lamp (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.7m) provides ambient lighting.

## 4. Scene Graph
The desk is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, as it serves as the focal point of the office setup. This placement maximizes functionality and maintains a modern aesthetic, providing ample space for movement and additional furniture. The desk's dimensions (1.8m x 0.8m x 0.75m) fit well within the room, ensuring balance and proportion.

The office chair is positioned in front of the desk, facing the north wall. This placement facilitates a functional workspace, with the chair's dimensions (0.627m x 0.603m x 0.778m) allowing it to fit comfortably in the designated area. The chair's ergonomic design enhances comfort, aligning with the user's modern style preference.

Floating shelves are mounted on the north wall above the desk, slightly to the right, to avoid interference with the office chair. The shelves' dimensions (1.2m x 0.3m x 0.2m) fit well within the available wall space, providing easy access to stored items and maintaining a cohesive modern look.

The desk lamp is placed on the desk, facing the south wall, to provide adequate task lighting. Its dimensions (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) ensure it fits comfortably on the desk without causing spatial conflicts, aligning with the user's modern style preference.

The monitor is placed on the desk, adjacent to the desk lamp, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.2m x 0.4m) allow it to fit comfortably alongside the lamp, maintaining the aesthetic consistency of the room and supporting the primary function of the workspace.

Bookends are placed on the floating shelves, providing book support without interfering with the workspace below. Their dimensions (0.2m x 0.1m x 0.2m) fit well on the shelves, enhancing storage and display functionality.

The potted plant is placed on the floating shelves, adding decorative value without obstructing workspace functionality. Its dimensions (0.229m x 0.177m x 0.224m) ensure it fits well on the shelves, providing a nice contrast against the walnut shelves.

The rug is placed in the middle of the room, under the desk and office chair, defining the workspace area. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.01m) allow it to fit comfortably without interfering with the footrest, enhancing both comfort and aesthetics.

The floor lamp is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, providing ambient lighting to the room. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.7m) ensure it does not obstruct pathways or the view of the monitor, maintaining the modern aesthetic and balance in the room layout.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed according to the user's preferences and design principles, ensuring a functional and aesthetically pleasing modern office setup. The arrangement maintains balance and proportion, with no spatial conflicts or obstructions.
