## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a cozy reading nook within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary elements of this nook include a soft beige armchair, a round side table, and a white floor lamp, all contributing to a warm and inviting atmosphere. The user emphasizes comfort and functionality, with the armchair providing ergonomic support for extended reading sessions. The side table is intended to hold books or drinks, complementing the nook's color scheme of soft beige and white. Adequate lighting is ensured by the floor lamp, enhancing the cozy ambiance without causing visual distractions. Additional recommendations include a small bookshelf, a cozy rug, a decorative cushion, and a small plant to introduce a touch of nature and further enhance the nook's aesthetic and functional appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into specific substructures to accommodate the reading nook. The primary substructure is the Reading Area, located against the east wall, which houses the armchair, side table, and floor lamp. This area is designed to provide a comfortable and inviting space for reading. The Storage Area is suggested for a small bookshelf to hold books and decorative items, enhancing both functionality and aesthetics. The Comfort Zone includes a cozy rug and a decorative cushion to add warmth and texture. Lastly, the Natural Element Zone is introduced with a small plant on the side table, contributing to a tranquil atmosphere.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Reading Area, a cozy beige armchair (0.9m x 0.85m x 1.0m) is recommended for comfortable seating. A modern white side table (0.627m x 0.621m x 0.836m) is suggested for holding items, while a modern white floor lamp (0.601m x 0.601m x 1.902m) provides essential lighting. In the Storage Area, a small bookshelf was initially recommended but later removed due to spatial constraints. The Comfort Zone features a cozy wool rug (1.5m x 1.0m x 0.02m) and a decorative beige cushion (0.422m x 0.419m x 0.408m) to enhance comfort. The Natural Element Zone includes a small plant in a ceramic pot (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) to add a touch of nature.

## 4. Scene Graph
The beige armchair is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, to create a sense of enclosure and comfort, essential for a reading nook. Its dimensions (0.9m x 0.85m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, leaving space for the side table and lamp. This placement aligns with the user's preference for a cozy reading nook, with the armchair as a central piece, and adheres to design principles by utilizing the wall for support and facing into the room for balance.

The side table is positioned to the left of the armchair when facing it, adjacent to the armchair on the east wall. Its dimensions (0.627m x 0.621m x 0.836m) fit comfortably next to the armchair, ensuring easy accessibility for holding items like books or a cup of tea. This placement enhances the cozy reading nook, maintaining balance and proportion while adhering to the user's preferences.

The floor lamp is placed to the right of the armchair, also against the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (0.601m x 0.601m x 1.902m) ensure it provides adequate lighting without obstructing the existing setup. This placement complements the armchair and side table in style and color, creating a balanced and harmonious setup that enhances the nook's functionality.

The rug is centrally placed under the armchair, side table, and slightly extending under the floor lamp, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (1.5m x 1.0m x 0.02m) ensure it does not interfere with the current layout or extend into high-traffic areas. This placement adds warmth and texture, visually anchoring the arrangement and enhancing the cozy ambiance.

The cushion is placed on the armchair, enhancing comfort and maintaining the cozy aesthetic of the reading nook. Its dimensions (0.422m x 0.419m x 0.408m) are suitable for the armchair, providing additional comfort without obstructing the user. The cushion's beige color complements the armchair, enhancing aesthetic appeal.

The plant is placed on the side table, facing the west wall, adding a decorative touch without any spatial conflicts. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) are proportionate to the side table, enhancing the aesthetic value and adding a touch of nature to the cozy reading environment.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified due to the limited length of the east wall, which could not accommodate all the intended objects, including the armchair, side table, floor lamp, and bookshelf. To resolve this, the bookshelf was removed, as it was deemed less critical to the user's preference for a cozy reading nook centered around the armchair, side table, and floor lamp. This decision ensured that the primary elements of the nook remained intact, maintaining the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.
