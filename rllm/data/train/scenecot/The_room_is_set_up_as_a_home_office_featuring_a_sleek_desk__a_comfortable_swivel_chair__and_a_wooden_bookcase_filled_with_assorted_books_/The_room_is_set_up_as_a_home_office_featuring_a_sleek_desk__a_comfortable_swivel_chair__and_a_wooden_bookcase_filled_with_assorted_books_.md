## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a home office that balances function and style, featuring a sleek desk, a comfortable swivel chair, and a wooden bookcase. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user desires a modern aesthetic with functional elements such as a desk lamp for adequate lighting and a minimalist rug to define the space without cluttering it. Decorative items like wall art and a potted plant are also preferred to enhance the office's visual appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures: the Workspace Area, which includes the desk and chair for productivity; the Storage Area, featuring the bookcase for organizing books; and the Decorative Area, which incorporates elements like wall art and a potted plant to enhance aesthetics. The central part of the room remains open to maintain a spacious feel, with a minimalist rug to subtly define the area.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Workspace Area, a modern black desk (1.5m x 0.75m x 0.75m) and an ergonomic gray swivel chair (0.686m x 0.681m x 1.043m) are recommended. The Storage Area includes a classic wooden bookcase (0.859m x 0.224m x 1.979m) for book organization. The Decorative Area features an abstract wall art piece (1.2m x 0.05m x 0.8m) and a modern potted plant (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.8m). A minimalist beige rug (2.0m x 2.0m x 0.01m) is suggested for the central area, and a modern silver desk lamp (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) is recommended for task lighting.

## 4. Scene Graph
The desk is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, as it serves as the primary workspace. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.75m x 0.75m) allow it to fit comfortably along the wall, maximizing space utilization and creating a focal point in the room. This placement aligns with the user's preference for a sleek desk setup and adheres to design principles of balance and proportion.

The swivel chair is positioned directly in front of the desk, facing the south wall. This placement ensures functionality and aesthetic alignment with the user's home office setup. The chair's dimensions (0.686m x 0.681m x 1.043m) allow it to fit comfortably in front of the desk, maintaining balance and proportion while facilitating a natural working posture.

The bookcase is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This location ensures easy access to books while seated at the desk and maintains a functional and aesthetically pleasing layout. The bookcase's dimensions (0.859m x 0.224m x 1.979m) fit well within the room's height, complementing the desk and chair arrangement.

The desk lamp is placed on the desk, facing the south wall, to provide direct lighting to the workspace. Its small footprint (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) ensures it fits easily on the desk without causing spatial conflicts, enhancing the desk area with necessary task lighting.

The rug is placed under the desk and swivel chair, in the middle of the room. Its dimensions (2.0m x 2.0m x 0.01m) allow it to fit under the desk and chair area without extending under the bookcase, avoiding interference. The rug enhances the aesthetic appeal of the home office, aligning with the user's vision of a sleek and comfortable workspace.

The wall art is placed on the north wall, above the desk. This placement ensures the art is prominently displayed, enhancing the room's decor while maintaining the functionality and flow of the home office setup. The art's dimensions (1.2m x 0.05m x 0.8m) allow it to fit comfortably above the desk without interfering with any floor space or objects.

The potted plant is placed on the floor to the right of the desk, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.8m) fit comfortably next to the desk, where it complements the existing decor without interfering with functionality. This placement maintains the functional and aesthetic balance of the room.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed in a manner that respects the room's dimensions and the user's preferences, ensuring a harmonious and functional home office setup.
