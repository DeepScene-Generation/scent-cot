## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a chic bathroom layout that emphasizes minimalism and elegance, featuring a white ceramic sink, a modern faucet, and a sleek-framed mirror. The room is spacious, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for additional elements that enhance both functionality and aesthetics. The user prioritizes a modern aesthetic, with a focus on essential objects that serve dual purposes, ensuring the bathroom remains both functional and visually appealing.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The bathroom is divided into several functional substructures based on user requirements. The Sink Area is the focal point, featuring the ceramic sink, faucet, and mirror. The Storage Area includes a cabinet for toiletries, maintaining the minimalist aesthetic. The Towel Area is designed for convenience, with a towel rack placed for easy access. The Toilet Area is positioned for privacy and functionality, while the Shower Area is designated for bathing, ensuring accessibility and space efficiency. Lastly, the Rug Area provides comfort and safety, particularly around the sink.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sink Area, a modern white ceramic sink (0.656m x 0.491m x 0.932m) is recommended, complemented by a chrome modern faucet (0.181m x 0.311m x 0.782m) and a sleek silver mirror (0.694m x 0.089m x 1.544m). The Storage Area features a modern white cabinet (0.8m x 0.3m x 0.8m) for toiletries. In the Towel Area, a chrome towel rack (0.6m x 0.1m x 0.05m) is suggested for holding towels. The Toilet Area includes a modern white ceramic toilet (0.7m x 0.4m x 0.8m), while the Shower Area features a transparent glass shower (1.147m x 1.041m x 2.298m). Finally, a grey minimalist rug (1.0m x 0.6m x 0.01m) is recommended for the Rug Area to enhance comfort and safety.

## 4. Scene Graph
The ceramic sink is placed centrally against the north wall, facing the south wall, serving as the focal point for basic hygiene and grooming. Its compact size ensures it fits comfortably without occupying excessive space, allowing for easy access and visibility, adhering to both functional and aesthetic requirements. The modern faucet is installed directly on the ceramic sink, facing the south wall, ensuring functional integration and maintaining a cohesive and chic aesthetic. The sleek mirror is mounted on the north wall directly above the ceramic sink, facing the south wall, optimizing functionality for grooming and enhancing space perception. The countertop is placed on the north wall, directly under the ceramic sink and modern faucet, ensuring functional alignment and maintaining the sleek, modern style. The towel rack is placed on the north wall, to the right of the ceramic sink, facing the south wall, ensuring easy access and maintaining the room's modern aesthetic. The cabinet is placed on the north wall, to the left of the ceramic sink, facing the south wall, providing convenient storage near the sink while maintaining aesthetic appeal. The toilet is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, complementing the existing layout and ensuring accessibility and aesthetic flow. The shower area is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall, allowing for optimal use of space and maintaining a chic and modern aesthetic. The rug is placed in front of the ceramic sink, centered along the north wall, providing a comfortable standing area and enhancing the room's aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
There are no conflicts identified in the current layout, as all objects are placed with consideration of spatial relationships and user preferences. The placement of each object adheres to design principles, ensuring balance, proportion, and functionality, while maintaining the chic and modern aesthetic desired by the user.
