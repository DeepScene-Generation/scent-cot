## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a serene yoga studio with a calming ambiance, emphasizing a central fountain and an array of soft floor cushions. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a fountain area, cushioned seating area, yoga practice area, and minimalistic wall design. The user prefers a tranquil environment with natural elements, minimal visual distractions, and an unobstructed ceiling skylight to enhance natural lighting. The design should prioritize essential elements to maintain a serene and functional space.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Fountain Area is central to the room, serving as the focal point for ambiance. The Cushioned Seating Area surrounds the fountain, providing comfort and space for meditation. The Yoga Practice Area is designed to be open and unobstructed, allowing for diverse yoga practices. The Minimalistic Wall Design includes abstract artwork on the north wall to enhance focus without clutter. Additionally, a small plant arrangement on the south wall introduces natural elements, contributing to the room's tranquility.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Fountain Area, a modern stone fountain measuring 1.0 meters by 1.0 meters by 1.2 meters is recommended to serve as the central calming element. The Cushioned Seating Area features minimalist fabric cushions, each 0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.15 meters, arranged around the fountain for comfort and meditation. The Yoga Practice Area includes a minimalist rubber yoga mat (1.8 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.02 meters) for functionality. The Minimalistic Wall Design is enhanced with abstract canvas artwork (1.2 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.8 meters) on the north wall. A natural organic plant (0.9 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meters) is placed on the east wall to enhance tranquility. Cork flooring (5.0 meters by 5.0 meters by 0.1 meters) covers the entire floor, providing a comfortable surface for movement.

## 4. Scene Graph
The fountain, a central element for ambiance, is placed in the middle of the room, facing all sides equally. Its dimensions (1.0m x 1.0m x 1.2m) allow it to serve as a focal point without obstructing movement, aligning with the user's desire for a soothing and open space. The placement ensures the sound of water fills the room evenly, enhancing the calming atmosphere.

Cushion_1 is placed on the floor, adjacent to the fountain, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.15m) ensure it does not obstruct the path to the fountain, providing a comfortable seating option for meditation. This placement complements the central fountain and allows for additional cushions to be added symmetrically.

Cushion_2 is positioned to the right of cushion_1, maintaining the ambiance and providing more seating options. Its placement ensures no spatial conflicts and supports the user's preference for soft floor cushions around the fountain. The dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.15m) allow it to fit seamlessly into the seating area.

Cushion_3 is placed to the left of cushion_1, extending the seating arrangement around the fountain. This symmetrical placement enhances the serene and balanced ambiance of the yoga studio. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.15m) ensure it fits comfortably within the space.

The plant is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (0.9m x 0.5m x 1.0m) make it suitable for a corner, where it enhances tranquility without obstructing movement or view. This placement maintains openness and complements the room's modern and minimalist elements.

The artwork is mounted on the north wall, serving as a visual focal point. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.05m x 0.8m) allow it to fit comfortably without overwhelming the space. This placement aligns with the user's vision of a soothing environment, enhancing the calming ambiance.

Yoga_mat_1 is placed along the west wall, facing the east wall. Its dimensions (1.8m x 0.6m x 0.02m) ensure it does not obstruct the central area, providing a dedicated yoga practice space. This placement maintains balance and proportion in the room layout.

The cork flooring covers the entire floor, providing a comfortable and natural surface for yoga practice. Its dimensions (5.0m x 5.0m x 0.1m) ensure it does not interfere with the spatial arrangement of objects, enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to insufficient space on the west wall to accommodate both yoga mats. To resolve this, yoga_mat_2 was removed, as it was deemed less critical than maintaining the serene ambiance with the fountain and cushions. This decision aligns with the user's preference for a tranquil yoga studio, ensuring the room remains functional and aesthetically pleasing.
