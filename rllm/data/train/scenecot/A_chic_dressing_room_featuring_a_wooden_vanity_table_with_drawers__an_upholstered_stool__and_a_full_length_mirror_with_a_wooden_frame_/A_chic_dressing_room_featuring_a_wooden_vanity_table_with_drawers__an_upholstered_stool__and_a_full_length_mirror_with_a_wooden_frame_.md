## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a chic dressing room that emphasizes elegance and functionality. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, is to feature a wooden vanity table with drawers, an upholstered stool, and a full-length mirror with a wooden frame. The user desires a layout that highlights the elegance of the wooden elements and ensures visual harmony. Additional items such as a jewelry organizer, floor lamp, small rug, and decorative vase are suggested to enhance both functionality and aesthetic appeal, with a total of no more than 11 items to maintain balance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Vanity Area is designated for the vanity table and stool, providing a space for dressing and preparation. The Reflection Area is intended for the full-length mirror, offering an unobstructed view for outfit checks. The Lighting Area includes both the floor lamp and ceiling light to ensure adequate illumination. The Comfort Area is defined by the placement of a small rug, adding comfort and style. Lastly, the Decorative Area is enhanced by a decorative vase, adding a touch of elegance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Vanity Area, a chic wooden vanity table with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended, accompanied by an upholstered stool measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.45 meters. The Reflection Area features a full-length mirror with a wooden frame, sized at 0.6 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.8 meters. The Lighting Area includes a brass floor lamp (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.5 meters) and a crystal ceiling light (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.25 meters). The Comfort Area is enhanced by a chic wool rug measuring 1.5 meters by 1.0 meters by 0.01 meters. Finally, the Decorative Area includes a ceramic decorative vase (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.4 meters) and a metal jewelry organizer (0.3 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.4 meters).

## 4. Scene Graph
The vanity table, a key component of the chic dressing room, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures easy access and functionality, aligning with the chic aesthetic. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.5m x 0.75m) allow it to fit comfortably without overwhelming the space. The upholstered stool is positioned directly in front of the vanity table, facing the south wall, ensuring functional and aesthetic integration. Its size (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.45m) allows it to fit comfortably without obstructing other elements.

The full-length mirror is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall, providing a full view reflection. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.05m x 1.8m) ensure it stands upright without encroaching on other spaces. The jewelry organizer is placed on the vanity table, to the right side, ensuring accessibility and maintaining the chic style. Its small footprint (0.3m x 0.2m x 0.4m) allows it to sit comfortably without overwhelming the space.

The floor lamp is placed to the left of the vanity table, facing the south wall, providing additional lighting. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.5m) ensure it does not block pathways or interfere with the stool. The rug is placed in the middle of the room, providing comfort and enhancing the chic design. Its size (1.5m x 1.0m x 0.01m) ensures it does not obstruct movement or functionality.

The decorative vase is placed on the vanity table, to the right of the jewelry organizer, enhancing the vanity area without compromising functionality. Its small size (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.4m) ensures it does not interfere with the use of the vanity table. The ceiling light is centrally placed on the ceiling, providing main lighting for the room. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.25m) ensure it does not interfere with floor space or other objects.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The layout ensures that all objects are placed without spatial conflicts, maintaining the chic aesthetic and functionality of the dressing room. The careful arrangement of objects ensures a harmonious and elegant environment, aligning with the user's vision.
