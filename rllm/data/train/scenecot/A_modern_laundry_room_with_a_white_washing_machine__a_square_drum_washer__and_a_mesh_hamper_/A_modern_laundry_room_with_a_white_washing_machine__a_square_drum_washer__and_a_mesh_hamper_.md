## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a modern laundry room that emphasizes both functionality and aesthetics. Essential appliances include a white washing machine, a square drum washer, and a mesh hamper, all contributing to a clean and minimalist design. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for efficient arrangement. The south wall is designated for the appliance zone, ensuring ergonomic access and operational efficiency. Additional elements such as a folding drying rack, ironing board, laundry basket, and wall-mounted cabinet are inferred to enhance functionality while maintaining the minimalist aesthetic. The room also features a ventilation window on the north wall to provide natural light and prevent moisture buildup, with no window coverings recommended. The focus is on critical items, emphasizing dual-purpose objects like a folding drying rack that also serves as additional storage.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on user requirements. The Appliance Zone on the south wall accommodates the washing machine and drum washer, ensuring ergonomic access and operational efficiency. The Laundry Sorting Area includes the mesh hamper and laundry basket, facilitating easy sorting and transport of laundry. The Drying Area on the north wall features a folding drying rack, providing space for air-drying clothes. The Ironing Area on the east wall includes an ironing board, ensuring easy access for ironing tasks. The Storage Area on the west wall comprises detergent storage and a wall-mounted cabinet, optimizing space for storing laundry supplies.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Appliance Zone, a modern white washing machine (0.735m x 0.741m x 1.018m) and a square drum washer (0.7m x 0.7m x 1.0m) are recommended. The Laundry Sorting Area features a mesh hamper (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.7m) and a laundry basket (0.6m x 0.4m x 0.5m), both in white to match the room's aesthetic. The Drying Area includes a folding drying rack (1.0m x 0.5m x 1.5m) in silver, complementing the modern style. The Ironing Area features a white ironing board (1.2m x 0.4m x 0.9m), while the Storage Area includes a detergent storage unit (0.8m x 0.4m x 1.2m) and a wall-mounted cabinet (1.2m x 0.3m x 0.6m), both in white to maintain a cohesive look.

## 4. Scene Graph
The washing machine, a key element in the laundry room, is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures accessibility and aligns with plumbing connections, maintaining a clean aesthetic by keeping it out of direct sight when entering the room. The drum washer, placed adjacent to the washing machine on the south wall, also faces the north wall. This arrangement facilitates ease of use and maintains a modern look by keeping the appliances together, ensuring no spatial conflicts.

The mesh hamper is positioned to the left of the washing machine on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures easy access for sorting laundry without obstructing the operation of the washing machine or drum washer. The folding drying rack is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. This location provides balance by using the opposite wall and maintains the room's modern and organized appearance, ensuring no spatial conflicts with existing appliances.

The ironing board is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement keeps it accessible and out of the way of the main washing area on the south wall, ensuring it does not interfere with the drying rack on the north wall. The laundry basket is placed to the left of the mesh hamper on the south wall, facing the north wall. This ensures proximity to other laundry-related items, maintaining a logical workflow.

The detergent storage unit is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement ensures easy access to detergents without obstructing other appliances, maintaining a cohesive flow in the room. The wall-mounted cabinet is placed above the detergent storage on the west wall, facing the room. This optimizes vertical space and maintains proximity to where supplies are needed, ensuring easy access and a cohesive aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The arrangement of objects ensures a functional and aesthetically pleasing modern laundry room, with all elements strategically placed to avoid spatial conflicts and maintain a cohesive design.

                - Rotation of wall_mounted_cabinet_1: 90°
                - Rotation of detergent_storage_1: 90°
                - Rotation difference: |90 - 90| = 0°
            - conclusion: Using length dimension for directional constraint
        2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'above' relation
            - calculation:
                - detergent_storage_1 size: 0.8 (length)
                - Cluster size (above): 0.0 (non-directional)
            - conclusion: No directional constraint applied
        3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'west_wall' constraint
            - calculation:
                - wall_mounted_cabinet_1 size: length=1.2, width=0.3, height=0.6
                - x_min = 0 + 0.3/2 = 0.15
                - x_max = 0 + 0.3/2 = 0.15
                - y_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 1.2/2 = 0.6
                - y_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 1.2/2 = 4.4
                - z_min = z_max = 0.6/2 = 0.3
            - conclusion: Possible position: (0.15, 0.15, 0.6, 4.4, 0.3, 2.7)
        4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
            - calculation:
                - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.0-0.0), y(0.0-0.0)
                - Final coordinates: x=0.15, y=4.320538334658986, z=2.562262683793593
            - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.15, y: 4.320538334658986, z: 2.562262683793593
        5. reason: Collision check with detergent_storage_1
            - calculation:
                - Overlap detection: 0.15 ≤ 0.2 ≤ 0.15 → No collision
            - conclusion: No collision detected
        6. reason: Final position calculation
            - calculation:
                - Final coordinates: x=0.15, y=4.320538334658986, z=2.562262683793593
            - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.15, y: 4.320538334658986, z: 2.562262683793593
