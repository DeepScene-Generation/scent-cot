## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a classic dining space that emphasizes elegance and functionality. The room is designed to accommodate a long wooden dining table, upholstered dining chairs, and a crystal chandelier, all of which contribute to a sophisticated ambiance. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user prefers a classic style, focusing on a central dining feature that includes the table and chandelier, with additional elements like a sideboard for storage and a rug to define the dining area. The aesthetic appeal is enhanced by wall art, and the chandelier is intended to add a luxurious touch while providing optimal lighting.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Dining Area is the central zone, featuring the dining table and chairs, designed for hosting and dining. The Lighting Area is focused on the chandelier, which is positioned to illuminate the dining table effectively. The Storage Area includes a sideboard placed against the south wall, providing storage for dining essentials. These substructures ensure that the room maintains its classic style while optimizing functionality and aesthetics.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Dining Area, a classic long wooden dining table measuring 2.5 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.75 meters is recommended, accompanied by six classic upholstered dining chairs, each measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter. The Lighting Area features a crystal chandelier with dimensions of 0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 1.0 meter, providing central lighting. The Storage Area includes a classic wooden sideboard measuring 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter, offering functional storage space while complementing the room's aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dining table, a central piece in the classic dining space, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures balance and symmetry, providing a central dining feature that aligns with the user's preference for a classic style. The table's dimensions (2.5m x 1.0m x 0.75m) allow it to fit comfortably within the room, leaving ample space for movement and seating.

Dining chair 1 is placed to the right of the dining table, facing the west wall. This placement provides a balanced layout and aligns with the classic dining arrangement, allowing for easy access and functional use during dining. The chair's dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) ensure it fits comfortably next to the table without spatial conflicts.

Dining chair 2 is positioned to the left of the dining table, facing the east wall. This placement complements the existing setup, maintaining balance and symmetry, which are essential design principles in classic interiors. The chair's dimensions allow for easy access to the dining table while maintaining a visually pleasing arrangement.

Dining chair 3 is placed in front of the dining table, facing the south wall. This arrangement creates a harmonious seating layout around the table, ensuring no spatial conflicts with existing objects. The chair's placement aligns with the user's preference for a classic dining space, adhering to design principles by maintaining balance and proportion.

Dining chair 4, initially placed behind the dining table, was repositioned due to spatial conflicts. It is now placed on the north wall, facing the dining table. This adjustment maintains the room's symmetry and functionality, ensuring the seating arrangement complements the classic dining setup.

Dining chair 5 is placed on the right side of the dining table, adjacent to dining chair 1, facing the west wall. This arrangement provides additional seating, maintaining balance and enhancing the dining area's functionality without overcrowding.

Dining chair 6, initially placed behind the dining table, was also repositioned due to spatial conflicts. It is now placed on the north wall, facing the dining table. This placement maintains symmetry and functionality, completing the seating arrangement around the dining table.

The chandelier is placed on the ceiling, directly above the dining table, providing central lighting. This placement ensures even illumination across the table, aligning with the user's classic dining space preference. The chandelier's dimensions (0.8m x 0.8m x 1.0m) fit well above the table without overwhelming the space.

The sideboard is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement complements the dining table setup, maintaining the room's classic aesthetic while providing functional storage space. The sideboard's dimensions (1.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) ensure it fits comfortably against the wall, preventing clutter in the main dining area.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose with dining chairs 4 and 6, initially positioned behind the dining table, which would have placed them out of bounds. To resolve this, both chairs were repositioned to the north wall, facing the dining table. This adjustment maintains the room's symmetry and functionality, ensuring the seating arrangement complements the classic dining setup without spatial conflicts.

    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=4.5205, y=4.75, z=0.5

For sideboard_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with south_wall
        - calculation:
            - Rotation of sideboard_1: 0.0°
            - Rotation of south_wall: 0.0°
            - Rotation difference: |0.0 - 0.0| = 0.0°
        - conclusion: Using length dimension for directional constraint
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'south_wall' relation
        - calculation:
            - sideboard_1 size: 1.5 (length)
            - Cluster size (south_wall): max(0.0, 1.5) = 1.5
        - conclusion: Size constraint (south_wall): 1.5
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'south_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - sideboard_1 size: length=1.5, width=0.5, height=1.0
            - Room size: 5.0x5.0x3.0
            - x_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 1.5/2 = 0.75
            - x_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 1.5/2 = 4.25
            - y_min = 0.0 + 0.0/2 + 0.5/2 = 0.25
            - y_max = 0.0 + 0.0/2 + 0.5/2 = 0.25
            - z_min = z_max = 1.0/2 = 0.5
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.75, 4.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:

        - conclusion: Final position: x: 1.1483, y: 0.25, z: 0.5
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
