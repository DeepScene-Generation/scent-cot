## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user has described a room with dimensions of 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters by 3.0 meters, indicating a spacious area. The primary elements include a wooden storage cabinet with a contemporary design and a high back chair featuring a plush fabric cushion. The user prefers a minimalist appeal with additional storage solutions and a seating area enhanced by a side table and a lamp. Implicit needs identified include a coffee table, a rug to define the seating area, and decorative elements like artwork or a plant to add personality. The user values natural light, suggesting the use of reflective surfaces or lighter colors to enhance this effect. Up to twelve objects are recommended to fulfill these requirements, enhancing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures based on user requirements. The South Wall Area is designated for the storage cabinet, serving as a focal point upon entering the room. The West Wall Area is intended for the seating arrangement, including the high back chair, side table, and floor lamp, creating a cohesive seating nook. The Middle of the Room Area is reserved for the coffee table and rug, serving as the central gathering point. The East Wall Area is allocated for artwork, providing a visual focal point opposite the seating arrangement. These substructures ensure a balanced and functional layout that aligns with the user's contemporary style preference.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the South Wall Area, a contemporary wooden storage cabinet with dimensions of 1.08 meters by 0.395 meters by 2.0 meters is recommended for storage purposes. The West Wall Area features a high back chair (0.7 meters by 0.535 meters by 0.801 meters) with a plush fabric cushion, complemented by a side table (0.559 meters by 0.559 meters) and a floor lamp (1.8 meters in height) to enhance the seating area. The Middle of the Room Area includes a minimalist glass coffee table (1.0 meter by 0.6 meter by 0.4 meter) and a modern beige rug (2.997 meters by 1.962 meters by 0.0027 meters) to define the central space. The East Wall Area is adorned with contemporary canvas artwork (1.0 meter by 0.1 meter by 1.5 meters) to add personality and visual interest.

## 4. Scene Graph
The storage cabinet is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement is chosen because the cabinet is a functional piece meant for storage and should be placed against a wall for stability and aesthetic purposes. Its dimensions (2.0 meters in height, 1.08 meters in length, and 0.395 meters in width) fit comfortably on the south wall, leaving ample room for other elements. This placement aligns with the user's preference for a contemporary design and a well-organized space, providing balance and making good use of vertical space without cluttering the room.

The high back chair is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement ensures no spatial conflict with the storage cabinet and aligns with the user's preference for a contemporary design with functional seating. The chair's dimensions (0.7 meters by 0.535 meters by 0.801 meters) allow it to fit comfortably along the west wall, maintaining balance and proportion. Its orientation toward the east wall enhances the room's functionality as a seating area while adhering to modern design principles.

The coffee table is placed in the middle of the room, serving as a central piece between the seating arrangement and other furniture. Its dimensions (1.0 meter by 0.6 meter by 0.4 meter) and transparent material ensure it does not visually clutter the space, preserving an open feel. This placement allows the coffee table to serve as a practical surface for items, enhancing the utility of the seating area while maintaining the contemporary design theme.

The rug is placed under the coffee table, in the middle of the room. This positioning ensures that the rug enhances the room's aesthetic while avoiding conflicts with other furniture. The rug's dimensions (2.997 meters by 1.962 meters by 0.0027 meters) allow it to fit comfortably without overlapping other objects. Its modern style complements the existing contemporary design elements, and its beige color adds warmth to the room.

The artwork is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall, providing a balanced visual aesthetic to the room. This placement does not interfere with any existing furniture, adheres to the user's contemporary style preference, and follows design principles by creating a focal point that complements the room's decor. The artwork's dimensions (1.0 meter by 0.1 meter by 1.5 meters) ensure it fits well on the wall, adding visual interest without overwhelming the space.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts were identified with the floor lamp and side table. The width of the floor lamp was too small to accommodate the plant to its left, and the width of the high back chair was too small to accommodate the side table to its right. To resolve these conflicts, the plant and side table were removed based on their lower functional priority compared to the other elements in the room. This decision ensures the room maintains its contemporary design and functional seating area without overcrowding the space.
