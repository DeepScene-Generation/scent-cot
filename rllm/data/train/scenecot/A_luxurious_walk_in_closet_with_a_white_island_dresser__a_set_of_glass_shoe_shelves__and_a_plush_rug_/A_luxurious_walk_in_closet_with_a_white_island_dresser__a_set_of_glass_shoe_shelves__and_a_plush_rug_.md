## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a luxurious walk-in closet with specific elements, including a white island dresser, glass shoe shelves, and a plush rug. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design emphasizes luxury and organization, with a focus on creating clear pathways for accessibility. The user desires a cohesive color scheme and high-quality materials to enhance the room's luxurious ambiance. Additional recommendations include a mirror, ambient lighting, seating, and storage solutions to complement the existing elements and enhance the overall experience of the closet.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Central Area is designated for the island dresser, serving as the focal point for storage and organization. The South Wall Area is intended for the glass shoe shelves, providing an elegant display for shoes. The Middle Area accommodates the plush rug, enhancing comfort and luxury. The Ceiling Area is reserved for ambient lighting to ensure adequate illumination. Additional substructures include the Vanity Area for the mirror and the Seating Area for a bench, both enhancing functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Central Area, a luxurious white island dresser (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.9m) is recommended to store jewelry and accessories. The South Wall Area features glass shoe shelves (2.0m x 0.4m x 2.0m) for displaying shoes elegantly. The Middle Area includes a plush rug (3.0m x 2.0m) to add comfort and elegance. The Ceiling Area is equipped with a gold ambient light fixture (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.3m) to provide even lighting. The Vanity Area includes a silver vanity mirror (0.8m x 0.1m x 1.5m) for reflection, while the Seating Area features a navy velvet bench (1.0m x 0.4m x 0.45m) for comfort. An accessory drawer (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.5m) is also recommended to complement the island dresser.

## 4. Scene Graph
The island dresser is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.9m) allow it to serve as a focal point while providing ample space for movement around it. This placement aligns with the user's vision of a luxurious walk-in closet, ensuring accessibility and aesthetic appeal. The shoe shelves are positioned against the south wall, facing the north wall. Their dimensions (2.0m x 0.4m x 2.0m) ensure they do not obstruct the room's flow and are easily visible upon entering, enhancing the room's luxurious feel. The plush rug is placed under the island dresser in the middle of the room. Its dimensions (3.0m x 2.0m) provide sufficient overlap, enhancing the room's visual appeal and comfort. The vanity mirror is placed behind the island dresser, facing the north wall. Its height (1.5m) ensures it complements the dresser's utility and aesthetic appeal. The ambient light is centrally located on the ceiling, facing downwards. Its placement ensures even lighting throughout the room, highlighting the luxurious elements. The bench is placed adjacent to the island dresser, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.4m x 0.45m) ensure it provides comfortable seating without disrupting the room's flow. The accessory drawer is placed adjacent to the island dresser, maintaining a cohesive look and ensuring easy access.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the placement of the coat rack next to the shoe shelves on the south wall. The width of the shoe shelves was insufficient to accommodate the coat rack, leading to a layout conflict. To resolve this, the coat rack was removed, as it was deemed less important compared to the user's preference for a luxurious walk-in closet with a white island dresser, glass shoe shelves, and a plush rug. This resolution maintained the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal, ensuring the user's vision was achieved.
