## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a serene reading corner within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary elements requested include a plush armchair, a wooden side table, and a floor lamp, all essential for creating a cozy and functional reading space. Additional elements such as a bookshelf and a rug are considered to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal. The user emphasizes ergonomic comfort, proper lighting, and easy accessibility while maintaining a cohesive visual flow.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into specific substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The Armchair Area is designated for comfortable seating, serving as the focal point of the reading corner. The Side Table Area is adjacent to the armchair, providing easy access to books and beverages. The Lighting Area, featuring the floor lamp, ensures adequate illumination for reading. A Bookshelf Area was initially considered for organizing books but was later removed due to spatial constraints. The Rug Area spans the middle of the room, providing comfort and defining the reading space.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Armchair Area, a classic-style armchair in beige fabric is recommended for its comfort and aesthetic appeal. The Side Table Area features a rustic wooden side table in walnut, complementing the armchair and providing functionality. The Lighting Area includes a contemporary brass floor lamp, essential for reading. A minimalist cream wool rug is suggested for the Rug Area, adding warmth and comfort. A cozy light grey cotton cushion is recommended for added comfort on the armchair, enhancing the reading experience.

## 4. Scene Graph
The armchair, a central element of the reading corner, is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (1.03m x 0.961m x 0.847m) allow it to serve as a focal point, providing comfortable seating while maintaining an open center for movement. This placement aligns with the user's vision of a serene reading corner, ensuring stability and balance.

The side table is positioned to the left of the armchair, also against the east wall, facing the west wall. With dimensions of 0.627m x 0.621m x 0.836m, it fits comfortably next to the armchair, offering easy access to books and beverages without obstructing movement or the armchair's functionality. This arrangement maintains a cohesive and functional reading corner.

The floor lamp is placed to the right of the armchair, against the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (0.601m x 0.601m x 1.902m) allow it to fit snugly between the armchair and the wall, providing adequate lighting for reading. This placement balances the visual composition of the reading corner and adheres to the user's vision.

The rug, measuring 2.997m x 1.962m x 0.0027m, is centrally placed under the armchair, side table, and floor lamp. It spans the middle of the room, extending towards the east wall, providing a visual and physical anchor for the seating area. This placement enhances the overall cozy and serene atmosphere desired by the user.

The cushion is placed on the armchair, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (0.449m x 0.407m x 0.163m) allow it to fit comfortably without disrupting the spatial arrangement or the armchair's functionality. It enhances seating comfort, aligning with the user's vision of a cozy reading corner.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts were identified due to spatial constraints. The armchair area was too small to accommodate both the cushion and the throw blanket, leading to the removal of the throw blanket based on its lower functional priority. Additionally, the east wall could not accommodate all intended objects, resulting in the removal of the bookshelf and plant. These adjustments ensured the room maintained its serene reading corner aesthetic while adhering to user preferences and functional needs.
