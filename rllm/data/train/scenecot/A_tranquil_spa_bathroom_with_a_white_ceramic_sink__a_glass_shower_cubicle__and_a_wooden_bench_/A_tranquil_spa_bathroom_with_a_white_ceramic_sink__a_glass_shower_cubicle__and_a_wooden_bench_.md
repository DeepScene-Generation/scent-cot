## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a tranquil spa bathroom characterized by a minimalist design and specific features such as a white ceramic sink, a glass shower cubicle, and a wooden bench. The room is intended to emphasize relaxation, with a focus on maintaining a clutter-free environment. The dimensions of the room are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user desires a modern aesthetic with functional elements that include storage for towels and spa essentials, as well as additional objects like a mirror, small plants, and a bath mat to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetics.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional zones based on the user's requirements. The Sink and Vanity Area is designated along the north wall for grooming purposes, featuring a ceramic sink and a wooden vanity. The Shower Area is located in the northwest corner, providing a space for the glass shower cubicle with a rainfall head. The Resting Area is along the south wall, where a wooden bench is placed for sitting and resting. The Storage Area is on the east wall, intended for storing towels and spa essentials. The central area of the room is reserved for decorative elements like a plant, enhancing the tranquil atmosphere.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sink and Vanity Area, a modern white ceramic sink (0.656m x 0.491m x 0.932m) and a wooden vanity (1.0m x 0.5m) are recommended to provide a cohesive and functional grooming space. The Shower Area features a modern glass shower cubicle (1.147m x 1.041m x 2.298m) with a ceiling-mounted rainfall shower head (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.1m) for a luxurious spa-like experience. In the Resting Area, a modern wooden bench (1.357m x 0.923m x 1.091m) is proposed for relaxation. The Storage Area includes minimalist wooden shelves (1.08m x 0.395m x 1.065m) for organizing towels and essentials. A natural ceramic potted plant (0.898m x 0.92m x 1.311m) is recommended for the central area to enhance the room's aesthetic. A modern light gray cotton bath mat (1.0m x 0.6m x 0.02m) is suggested for floor protection and comfort.

## 4. Scene Graph
