## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a tranquil yoga studio that emphasizes calmness and balance, essential for yoga practice. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a wooden floor, yoga blocks, and a wall shelf for mats, all contributing to a minimalist and serene aesthetic. The studio should provide ample space for practice, with durable flooring and storage solutions that maintain a clutter-free environment. Additional elements like a meditation cushion and a small plant are suggested to enhance the calming atmosphere while adhering to the minimalist style.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures: the central open space for yoga practice, ensuring unobstructed movement; the south wall area for yoga block storage, facilitating easy access; the east wall for the wall shelf, providing organized storage for mats; and the north wall for aesthetic enhancements like a small plant. The wooden floor covers the entire room, offering a safe and consistent practice surface. Each substructure is designed to optimize the room's functionality and maintain its tranquil aesthetic.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central practice area, two minimalist-style yoga mats are recommended, each measuring 1.8 meters by 0.6 meters, providing ample space for poses. Along the south wall, two foam yoga blocks, each 0.23 meters by 0.15 meters by 0.1 meters, are suggested for stability in poses. A wooden wall shelf, 2.069 meters by 0.284 meters by 1.923 meters, is recommended for the east wall to store mats. A gray cotton meditation cushion, 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.2 meters, is proposed for seated poses. Finally, a small plant in a ceramic pot, 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.5 meters, is suggested for the north wall to enhance the atmosphere.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden floor is a foundational element, covering the entire room (5.0m x 5.0m x 0.02m) to provide a consistent and safe practice area. It aligns with the user's preference for a wooden floor and supports the room's minimalist aesthetic. The yoga blocks are placed on the floor against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures they are easily accessible and maintain the room's tranquil and minimalist aesthetic. The wall shelf is mounted on the east wall, facing the west wall, positioned high enough to store mats without interfering with floor activities. This placement ensures it is easily accessible and maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic. The yoga mat is placed in the middle of the room, oriented lengthwise from north to south, providing ample space for practice and maintaining an open, uncluttered appearance. The meditation cushion is placed on the floor, directly to the left of the yoga mat, facing the north wall, ensuring a harmonious layout for yoga practice. The small plant is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall, adjacent to the yoga mat, enhancing the ambiance while maintaining the room's functionality and tranquility. The second yoga mat is placed to the right of the first mat, facing the north wall, ensuring both mats are accessible and functional for practice.

## 5. Global Check
There are no conflicts in the layout or size of the objects within the room. Each object is placed thoughtfully to ensure functionality and maintain the room's tranquil aesthetic, with no need for repositioning or deletion of objects.
