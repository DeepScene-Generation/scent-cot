## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a classic library setup within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters. The primary elements requested include a tall wooden bookcase, a wooden ladder, a brown leather armchair, and a green reading lamp. The user emphasizes a classic aesthetic, suggesting additional items like a classic-style rug, a small coffee table, and decorative elements such as a globe or antique clock to enhance the library atmosphere. The room's ample size allows for these elements to be arranged without overcrowding, ensuring both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Bookcase and Ladder Area is designated for the tall bookcase and ladder, providing access to high shelves. The Seating Area includes the brown leather armchair and a side table for the reading lamp, creating a cozy reading nook. The Lighting Area focuses on the placement of the green reading lamp to ensure adequate lighting for reading activities. Additionally, a central area is reserved for a classic-style rug and a small coffee table, enhancing the room's classic library ambiance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Bookcase and Ladder Area, a classic wooden bookcase measuring 2.0 meters by 0.4 meters by 2.5 meters is recommended, along with a wooden ladder of 0.4 meters by 0.3 meters by 2.5 meters. The Seating Area features a brown leather armchair (0.9 meters by 0.8 meters by 1.0 meter) and a wooden side table (0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.5 meters) to hold the reading lamp. The Lighting Area includes a green reading lamp (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.6 meters) to provide focused lighting. A classic wool rug (3.0 meters by 2.0 meters) and a wooden coffee table (1.0 meter by 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters) are recommended for the central area to enhance comfort and aesthetics.

## 4. Scene Graph
The bookcase is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, to serve as a focal point and provide stability. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.4m x 2.5m) allow it to fit comfortably, making it easily accessible and functional for storing books. The ladder is positioned adjacent to the bookcase on the north wall, facing the south wall, to facilitate access to high shelves. Its placement ensures no spatial conflicts and complements the bookcase's height and style.

The armchair is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall, to create a balanced reading area. Its dimensions (0.9m x 0.8m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably without interfering with the bookcase and ladder. The side table is positioned to the left of the armchair, facing the west wall, providing a convenient spot for the reading lamp and other items. The reading lamp is placed on the side table, facing the north wall, ensuring functional lighting for the reading area.

The rug is placed in the middle of the room, providing a central focal point and enhancing the classic library feel. Its dimensions (3.0m x 2.0m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing pathways. The coffee table is placed in front of the armchair, on the rug, facing the north wall, creating a cohesive seating area that complements the armchair and side table arrangement.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose regarding the side table's capacity to hold both the reading lamp and the globe. Given the user's preference for a classic library with a reading lamp, the globe was deemed less essential and removed to resolve the conflict. This decision ensures the side table remains functional and aesthetically pleasing, maintaining the room's classic library ambiance.

        - conclusion: Final position: x: 3.6999999999999993, y: 2.3910184907125767, z: 0.2
    5. reason: Collision check with rug_1
        - calculation:
            - Overlap detection: 0.5 ≤ 3.6999999999999993 ≤ 4.5 → No collision
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=3.6999999999999993, y=2.3910184907125767, z=0.2
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 3.6999999999999993, y: 2.3910184907125767, z: 0.2
