## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a traditional dining room characterized by a rectangular wooden table, upholstered chairs, and a classic rug. The room's dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user desires additional elements such as a vintage mirror, an elegant chandelier, and soft neutral wall colors to enhance the room's aesthetic. The primary functional requirement is to create a dining area that is both aesthetically pleasing and functional, with a focus on traditional style elements.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key substructures to accommodate the user's requirements. The Dining Area is the central zone, featuring the dining table and chairs. The Lighting Area is designated for the chandelier, providing ambient lighting. The Aesthetic Area includes the vintage mirror on the south wall, enhancing the room's visual appeal. The Storage Area is represented by the sideboard on the west wall, offering additional storage for dining essentials. The Decorative Area is highlighted by the centerpiece on the dining table, adding elegance to the setup.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Dining Area, a traditional wooden dining table (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.75m) and four upholstered chairs (each 0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) are recommended to maintain the traditional aesthetic. The Lighting Area features a traditional chandelier (0.7m x 0.7m x 0.5m) suspended from the ceiling. The Aesthetic Area includes a vintage mirror (1.2m x 0.05m x 1.0m) on the south wall. The Storage Area is enhanced by a traditional wooden sideboard (1.5m x 0.5m x 0.9m) on the west wall. The Decorative Area is completed with a classic ceramic centerpiece (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.5m) on the dining table.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dining table is placed centrally in the room, parallel to the north wall, to allow for comfortable seating and accessibility from all sides. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.75m) fit well within the room, making it the focal point of the dining area. This central placement ensures balance and symmetry, adhering to traditional dining room aesthetics.

Chair_1 is positioned in front of the dining table, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably, maintaining functionality and visual harmony. Chair_2 is placed to the left of the dining table, facing the east wall, ensuring balanced seating around the table. Chair_3 is positioned to the right of the dining table, facing the west wall, complementing the symmetrical arrangement. Chair_4 is placed behind the dining table, facing the north wall, completing the traditional seating setup.

The rug is placed on the floor, directly under the dining table and chairs, with dimensions (2.5m x 1.5m x 0.01m) that provide a comfortable boundary for the dining area. This placement enhances the room's warmth and traditional aesthetic.

The chandelier is suspended from the ceiling above the dining table, providing balanced lighting to the entire dining area. Its dimensions (0.7m x 0.7m x 0.5m) ensure it fits well without obstructing movement or view.

The vintage mirror is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.05m x 1.0m) fit well within the wall space, enhancing the room's aesthetic by reflecting the dining setup.

The sideboard is positioned against the west wall, facing the east wall. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.5m x 0.9m) allow it to complement the dining area, providing functional storage without disrupting the layout.

The centerpiece is placed in the center of the dining table, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.5m) ensure it serves as a decorative focal point without causing spatial conflicts.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects fit within the room's dimensions and layout, maintaining the traditional aesthetic and functional requirements. The arrangement ensures balance, proportion, and accessibility, adhering to the user's preferences and design principles.
