## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions an executive office that embodies elegance, authority, and functionality. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, is to be furnished with a mahogany desk, a high-back leather chair, and a credenza. The design emphasizes a professional and authoritative ambiance, with additional elements like a desk lamp and organizer to enhance the workspace's functionality and visual appeal. The seating area, centered around the high-back leather chair, requires a small side table and a floor lamp for added lighting and surface space, enhancing comfort and usability. The credenza area serves as a dedicated storage space, with a decorative piece or plant to soften its look and add greenery. Accessories should be minimal yet functional, complementing the authoritative style, and the overall arrangement should maintain unobstructed pathways for ease of movement, supporting ergonomic and efficient space use.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key substructures based on the user's requirements. The Desk Area is the central workspace, featuring the mahogany desk and associated accessories like a desk lamp and organizer. The Seating Area is centered around the high-back leather chair, complemented by a side table and floor lamp to enhance comfort and usability. The Credenza Area serves as a storage space, with a decorative piece and plant to add aesthetic value. Each substructure is designed to maintain the room's professional aesthetic while ensuring functionality and ease of movement.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Desk Area, a classic mahogany desk (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.8m) is recommended, accompanied by a modern metal desk lamp (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) and a modern wooden organizer (0.3m x 0.2m x 0.15m) to enhance functionality. The Seating Area includes a high-back leather chair (0.7m x 0.7m x 1.2m), a classic mahogany side table (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.5m), and a modern metal floor lamp (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.8m) for additional lighting. The Credenza Area features a classic mahogany credenza (1.8m x 0.5m x 1.0m), with a modern ceramic decorative piece (0.4m x 0.2m x 0.3m) and a plant in a ceramic pot (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) to enhance the aesthetic appeal.

## 4. Scene Graph
The mahogany desk is placed along the south wall, facing the north wall, to serve as the central workspace component. This placement ensures the desk is the focal point of the room, providing easy accessibility and maintaining balance and proportion. The high-back leather chair is positioned in front of the desk, facing the south wall, to facilitate a practical workspace. This arrangement aligns with the user's preference for an executive office setup, maintaining balance and proportion within the room. The credenza is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall, to provide accessible storage without obstructing the desk or chair. This placement complements the existing furniture and maintains a balanced aesthetic. The desk lamp is placed on the mahogany desk, facing the north wall, to provide necessary lighting for the workspace. Its small size ensures it fits comfortably on the desk without taking up too much space. The organizer is also placed on the desk, next to the desk lamp, to enhance functionality and maintain a balanced setup. The side table is placed to the right of the chair, facing the north wall, providing a convenient surface for personal items or documents. The floor lamp is placed adjacent to the chair, left of it, to provide optimal lighting for the seating area. It faces the north wall to maintain consistency with the room's design principles. The decorative piece is placed on the credenza, facing the west wall, to enhance the aesthetic appeal of the room without conflicting with other objects. The plant is placed on the credenza, slightly to the left of the decorative piece, ensuring it is not directly adjacent but still within the same area for visual cohesion.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects fit within the designated areas without overlapping or obstructing pathways, ensuring the room's functionality and aesthetic are maintained. The placement of each object aligns with the user's preferences and design principles, creating a cohesive and visually appealing executive office.
