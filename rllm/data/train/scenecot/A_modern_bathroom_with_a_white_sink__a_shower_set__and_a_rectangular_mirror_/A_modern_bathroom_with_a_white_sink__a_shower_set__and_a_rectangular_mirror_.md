## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern bathroom characterized by a minimalist style with neutral tones, focusing on a white sink, a shower set, and a rectangular mirror. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design should efficiently utilize space while ensuring the bathroom is well-lit and functional. The user prefers a modern aesthetic, emphasizing essential items that enhance both functionality and aesthetics without cluttering the space.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The bathroom is divided into three main substructures: the Sink and Mirror Area, the Shower Area, and the General Bathroom Area. The Sink and Mirror Area is designated for the white sink and rectangular mirror, serving as a focal point for daily grooming activities. The Shower Area is intended for a modern shower set, emphasizing durability and comfort. The General Bathroom Area includes additional essentials that enhance functionality while maintaining a minimalist and uncluttered appearance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sink and Mirror Area, a modern white ceramic sink (0.656m x 0.491m x 0.932m) and a rectangular glass mirror (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.8m) are recommended. The Shower Area features a modern chrome metal shower set (0.313m x 0.46m x 1.486m) to ensure a comfortable bathing experience. In the General Bathroom Area, a modern ceramic toilet (0.7m x 0.4m x 0.8m), a minimalist chrome metal towel rack (0.585m x 0.128m x 0.914m), a modern glass shelf (0.8m x 0.2m x 0.3m), and a modern metal ceiling light (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.1m) are proposed to enhance functionality and maintain the modern aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The white ceramic sink is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall, to serve as a focal point in the bathroom. Its dimensions (0.656m x 0.491m x 0.932m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, providing convenient plumbing access and aligning with the modern aesthetic. The placement leaves ample room for other elements like the shower set and mirror, creating a balanced layout.

Above the sink, the rectangular glass mirror is positioned on the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures functionality for reflection while washing and enhances the room's aesthetic by creating a coherent sink and mirror area. The mirror's dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.8m) allow it to fit comfortably above the sink, maintaining aesthetic balance.

The modern chrome metal shower set is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This positioning provides ample space for movement within the bathroom and complements the existing modern aesthetic. The shower set's dimensions (0.313m x 0.46m x 1.486m) ensure it fits well within the available space, providing necessary structural support and accessibility.

The modern ceramic toilet is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. This arrangement ensures no conflicts with existing objects while maintaining a functional and aesthetically pleasing bathroom layout. The toilet's dimensions (0.7m x 0.4m x 0.8m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, providing stability and efficient use of space.

The minimalist chrome metal towel rack is placed on the north wall, to the right of the sink, facing the south wall. This placement provides easy access to towels after washing hands, enhancing functionality. The towel rack's dimensions (0.585m x 0.128m x 0.914m) ensure it fits well within the room's layout, complementing the modern style.

The modern glass shelf is mounted on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures accessibility and visual balance within the bathroom, providing a convenient location for storing items. The shelf's dimensions (0.8m x 0.2m x 0.3m) allow it to fit comfortably on the wall, maintaining the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The modern metal ceiling light is centrally placed on the ceiling to ensure even distribution of light across all areas, including the sink, shower, and toilet areas. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.1m) ensure it does not interfere with other objects, providing necessary illumination and enhancing the room's usability and aesthetic appeal.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, a conflict was identified: the width of the shower set was too small to accommodate the bath mat placed left of it. To resolve this, the bath mat was removed based on its lower functional priority compared to the shower set, sink, and mirror, which are essential for the modern bathroom's functionality and aesthetic.
