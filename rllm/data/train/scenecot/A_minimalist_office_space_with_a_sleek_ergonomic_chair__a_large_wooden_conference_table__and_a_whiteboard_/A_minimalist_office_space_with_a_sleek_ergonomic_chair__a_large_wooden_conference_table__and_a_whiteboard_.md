## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a minimalist office space that emphasizes essential functionality. Key elements include a sleek ergonomic chair, a large wooden conference table, and a whiteboard. The conference table is central to the room's function, facilitating meetings and collaborative work, and should be robust with ample space for movement around it. The ergonomic chair is designed for prolonged comfortable seating, aligning with ergonomic design principles. The whiteboard is crucial for presentations and idea sharing, contributing to the room's uncluttered aesthetic. Additional objects like storage solutions, lighting for adequate illumination, and decorative elements are considered to enhance functionality and aesthetic appeal, all while maintaining a minimalist and modern style.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on user requirements. The central area is designated for the conference table, serving as the focal point for meetings. The seating area is positioned in front of the conference table to facilitate comfortable interaction. The presentation area is located on the north wall, where the whiteboard is placed for visibility during meetings. Storage is allocated against the west wall to maintain an organized space. Task lighting is provided on the conference table, and decorative elements are strategically placed to enhance the room's aesthetic without cluttering.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central area, a minimalist wooden conference table measuring 2.5 meters by 1.2 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended. The seating area features a sleek ergonomic chair made of metal and fabric, with dimensions of 0.7 meters by 0.7 meters by 1.2 meters. The presentation area includes a minimalist glass whiteboard measuring 1.5 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.0 meter. A modern metal desk lamp, measuring 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.5 meters, is recommended for task lighting on the conference table. A minimalist wooden storage cabinet, measuring 1.0 meter by 0.5 meter by 1.5 meters, is proposed for storing office supplies. A grey wool rug, measuring 3.0 meters by 2.0 meters, is suggested to cover the floor under the conference table. Finally, a modern metal clock, measuring 0.4 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.4 meters, is recommended for timekeeping.

## 4. Scene Graph
The conference table is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall, to serve as the focal point for meetings and collaborative work. Its dimensions (2.5m x 1.2m x 0.75m) allow it to fit comfortably within the 5m x 5m room without crowding, providing ample space for movement and additional seating. This placement aligns with the user's preference for a minimalist office space and adheres to design principles of balance and scale.

The ergonomic chair is positioned in front of the conference table, facing it and the north wall. This placement ensures functional comfort and adherence to the minimalist style, maintaining spatial harmony and balance in the office space. The chair's dimensions (0.7m x 0.7m x 1.2m) complement the table's size, ensuring no spatial conflicts and enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal.

The whiteboard is mounted on the north wall, facing the south wall, ensuring visibility from the conference table. Its minimalist design and dimensions (1.5m x 0.05m x 1.0m) maintain a clean and unobtrusive presence, aligning with the user's preference for functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The desk lamp is placed on the left side of the conference table, facing the north wall. This placement provides direct lighting for the table surface without obstructing views or movement, enhancing task lighting while maintaining the room's minimalist aesthetic. The lamp's dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.5m) ensure it does not interfere with interactions or views towards the whiteboard.

The storage cabinet is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.5m x 1.5m) fit well within the room, providing functional storage without overwhelming the space. This placement maintains the room's minimalist theme and provides convenient access to stored items.

The rug is placed centrally under the conference table, covering the floor in the middle of the room. Its dimensions (3.0m x 2.0m) allow it to extend beyond the table's edges, enhancing comfort during meetings and delineating the meeting area. This placement aligns with design principles and user input, enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal.

The clock is mounted on the north wall, above the whiteboard, ensuring visibility and functionality without disrupting the room's minimalist aesthetic. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.05m x 0.4m) ensure it does not obstruct the view of the whiteboard or interfere with other elements, contributing to a cohesive design.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the placement of the plant adjacent to the whiteboard on the north wall. The width of the whiteboard was too small to accommodate the plant without causing spatial conflicts. To resolve this, the plant was removed, as it was deemed less important compared to the whiteboard, which is crucial for the room's functionality and aligns with the user's preference for a minimalist office space. This resolution maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal, adhering to the user's vision.
