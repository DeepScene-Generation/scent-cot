## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern kitchen characterized by sleek and functional appliances, including a stainless steel refrigerator, oven, and microwave. The kitchen is designed with a focus on modern aesthetics and efficient space utilization. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user prioritizes essential items that align with the kitchen's modern functionality and aesthetic, ensuring the total number of objects does not exceed eleven.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The kitchen is divided into several functional substructures: the Refrigerator Area, Oven Area, Microwave Space, Appliance Access Layout, Meal Preparation Area, and Cleaning and Organization Zone. The Refrigerator Area is designated for the stainless steel refrigerator, providing storage for perishable items. The Oven Area includes the oven and a backsplash for aesthetic enhancement and wall protection. The Microwave Space is designed for the microwave, utilizing vertical space efficiently. The Appliance Access Layout considers ergonomic design, potentially incorporating a kitchen island for additional workspace. The Meal Preparation Area, centrally located, features a kitchen island for meal prep and storage. The Cleaning and Organization Zone includes a sink and dish rack, focusing on easy-to-clean surfaces and organization.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Refrigerator Area, a modern stainless steel refrigerator measuring 0.8 meters by 0.7 meters by 1.8 meters is recommended. The Oven Area includes a modern oven (0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.9 meters) and a glass backsplash (1.5 meters by 0.01 meters by 0.6 meters) for protection and decoration. The Microwave Space features a modern microwave (0.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.3 meters) placed on a wooden shelf (0.6 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters). The Meal Preparation Area includes a modern wooden kitchen island (1.5 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.9 meters) for meal prep and storage. The Cleaning and Organization Zone includes a stainless steel sink (0.6 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters) and a metal dish rack (0.4 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters) for organizing dishes. Additionally, a modern wooden storage cabinet (1.0 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.8 meters) is recommended for storing kitchen essentials.

## 4. Scene Graph
The refrigerator is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, as it is a large appliance that requires wall support for stability and space efficiency. Its modern style and stainless steel material complement the kitchen's contemporary design. The placement allows easy access and visibility, maintaining balance and functionality without obstructing other areas.

The oven is positioned to the right of the refrigerator on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures both appliances are accessible and maintains a modern aesthetic. The oven's dimensions allow it to fit comfortably next to the refrigerator, supporting efficient kitchen workflow and design balance.

The microwave is mounted above the oven on a shelf on the south wall, facing the north wall. This vertical placement avoids floor space conflicts and maintains accessibility. The microwave's modern style aligns with the kitchen's aesthetic, and its proximity to the oven supports practical cooking workflows.

The kitchen island is centrally placed in the room, facing the north wall. Its dimensions allow for easy access from all sides, complementing the modern kitchen style. The island's central location ensures it does not block appliances and maintains a balanced layout, enhancing meal preparation functionality.

The sink is placed on the south wall, left of the refrigerator, facing the north wall. This positioning facilitates efficient workflow by creating a functional triangle with the refrigerator and oven. The sink's modern style and stainless steel material align with the kitchen's aesthetic, supporting easy access to cleaning facilities.

The backsplash is mounted on the south wall above the oven, facing the north wall. It serves as a decorative and protective feature, enhancing the kitchen's modern look. The backsplash's glass material and white color complement the stainless steel appliances, maintaining a clean and modern aesthetic.

The dish rack is placed on the kitchen island, facing the north wall. This location ensures functionality and accessibility, promoting efficient dish organization. The dish rack's placement on the island maintains the room's modern aesthetic and does not interfere with the existing layout.

The microwave shelf is mounted on the south wall above the oven, facing the north wall. This placement provides a dedicated space for the microwave, maintaining accessibility and maximizing space utilization. The shelf's modern style and white color match the kitchen's elements, enhancing aesthetic appeal and practicality.

The storage cabinet is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement maintains an open and organized kitchen space, providing easy access to kitchen essentials. The cabinet's modern design complements the kitchen's aesthetic, ensuring functionality and balance in the layout.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The layout effectively accommodates all recommended objects, maintaining the kitchen's modern aesthetic and functional requirements without exceeding the user's specified limit of eleven objects.

            - x_max = 0 + 0.4/2 = 0.2
            - y_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 1.0/2 = 0.5
            - y_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 1.0/2 = 4.5
            - z_min = z_max = 1.8/2 = 0.9
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.2, 0.2, 0.5, 4.5, 0.9, 0.9)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.2-0.2), y(0.5-4.5)
            - Final coordinates: x=0.2, y=3.885, z=0.9
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.2, y: 3.885, z: 0.9
    5. reason: Collision check with west_wall
        - calculation:
            - Overlap detection: 0.2 ≤ 0.2 ≤ 0.2 → No collision
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=0.2, y=3.885, z=0.9
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.2, y: 3.885, z: 0.9
