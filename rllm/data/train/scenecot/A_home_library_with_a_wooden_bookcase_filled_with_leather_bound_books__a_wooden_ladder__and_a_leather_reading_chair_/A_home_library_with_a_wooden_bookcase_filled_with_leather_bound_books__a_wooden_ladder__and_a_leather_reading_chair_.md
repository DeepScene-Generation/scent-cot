## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a classic home library characterized by a sophisticated ambiance, featuring a wooden bookcase filled with leather-bound books, a wooden ladder for accessing higher shelves, and a leather reading chair. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, is to be arranged to maximize vertical space while maintaining a classic and sophisticated atmosphere. The primary functional needs include easy access to books, comfortable seating for reading, and an efficient layout that allows for smooth navigation within the room.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main areas based on the user's requirements: the Bookcase and Ladder Area, the Seating Area, and an Open Space for Navigation. The Bookcase and Ladder Area is located along the north wall, serving as the focal point for book storage and access. The Seating Area is designed to provide a comfortable reading spot, while the Open Space ensures easy movement throughout the room, enhancing the library's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Bookcase and Ladder Area, a classic wooden bookcase with dimensions of 2.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 2.5 meters is recommended, along with a matching wooden ladder measuring 0.5 meters by 0.3 meters by 2.5 meters. The Seating Area features a leather reading chair, complemented by a side table and a floor lamp for added functionality and ambiance. A classic wool rug, measuring 3.0 meters by 3.0 meters, is suggested for the Open Space to provide comfort and warmth, tying the room's elements together.

## 4. Scene Graph
The bookcase is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, to serve as the central feature of the library. Its dimensions (2.5m x 0.4m x 2.5m) allow it to fit comfortably within the 5.0-meter wall space, ensuring balance and proportion. This placement aligns with the user's vision of a home library, making the bookcase a primary feature. The ladder is positioned adjacent to the bookcase on the north wall, ensuring easy access to the upper shelves. Its height matches the bookcase, and its placement maintains aesthetic consistency with the room's classic style. The rug is placed in the middle of the room, providing a central area for reading and relaxation. Its dimensions (3.0m x 3.0m) allow it to unify the seating area without interfering with the bookcase or ladder access.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to the limited space on the north wall, which could not accommodate all intended objects. Specifically, the small table and plant were initially planned to be placed near the reading chair but were found to conflict with the bookcase and ladder. To resolve these conflicts, the small table and plant were removed, prioritizing the essential elements of the home library: the bookcase, ladder, and reading chair. This decision ensures the room remains functional and aesthetically aligned with the user's preferences, maintaining a classic library ambiance without overcrowding.
