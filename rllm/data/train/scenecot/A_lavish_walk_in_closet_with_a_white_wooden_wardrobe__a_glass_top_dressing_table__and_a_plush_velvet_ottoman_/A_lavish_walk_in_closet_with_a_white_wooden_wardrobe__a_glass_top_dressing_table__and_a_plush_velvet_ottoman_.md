## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a luxurious walk-in closet featuring a white wooden wardrobe, a glass-top dressing table, and a plush velvet ottoman. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design emphasizes a cohesive and elegant ambiance, with a focus on functionality for storage, dressing, and seating. The user prefers a lavish aesthetic, with additional elements like a mirror, rug, and decorative items to enhance the room's opulence and utility.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional areas based on the user's requirements. The Wardrobe Area is located on the south wall, dedicated to storage and organization with the white wooden wardrobe. The Dressing Table Area is positioned against the north wall, featuring a glass-top dressing table for grooming and makeup application, benefiting from optimal lighting. The Seating Area is centrally located, with a plush velvet ottoman providing a comfortable spot for outfit selection. Additional elements like a mirror, rug, and decorative items are strategically placed to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Wardrobe Area, a luxurious white wooden wardrobe measuring 2.5 meters by 0.6 meters by 2.4 meters is recommended. The Dressing Table Area includes a modern glass-top dressing table, 1.2 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.8 meters, complemented by a mirror above it. The Seating Area features a plush velvet ottoman, 0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.45 meters, with a luxurious beige wool rug, 1.2 meters by 1.2 meters, placed underneath. Decorative elements like a ceramic vase and a crystal ceiling light enhance the room's elegance and functionality.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wardrobe is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, as it is a significant piece that sets the tone for the room's layout. Its dimensions (2.5m x 0.6m x 2.4m) make it ideal for wall placement, maximizing storage space and leaving room for other elements. This placement aligns with the user's preference for a lavish, organized space and adheres to design principles of balance and proportion.

The dressing table is positioned on the east wall, facing the north wall, ensuring no conflict with the wardrobe. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.5m x 0.8m) fit well along the wall, maintaining a harmonious layout. This placement enhances the room's luxurious look, with the glass material adding elegance and aligning with the user's preferences.

The ottoman is centrally placed in front of the dressing table, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.8m x 0.45m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing room flow. This placement complements the dressing table, providing functional seating and adhering to design principles of balance and proportion.

The mirror is mounted on the east wall above the dressing table, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.05m x 1.2m) allow it to utilize vertical space effectively, enhancing the dressing area without spatial conflicts. This placement aligns with the user's vision of a lavish closet, adding functionality and maintaining aesthetic appeal.

The rug is placed on the floor under the ottoman, defining the seating area in the middle of the room. Its dimensions (1.2m x 1.2m) fit well without overlapping other furniture, enhancing the room's luxurious feel and providing functional decor.

The vase is placed on the dressing table on the east wall, slightly off-center to the right, facing the north wall. Its small size (0.15m x 0.15m x 0.3m) allows it to add visual interest without disrupting room flow, complementing the dressing table's elegance.

The ceiling light is centrally placed on the ceiling, facing downwards, to provide optimal lighting. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m) ensure it does not conflict with existing objects, enhancing the room's ambiance and functionality.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the placement of the vase and jewelry stand on the dressing table, as the vase's width was too small to accommodate the jewelry stand to its left. To resolve this, the jewelry stand was removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a lavish walk-in closet with essential elements like the wardrobe, dressing table, and ottoman. This adjustment maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal, ensuring a cohesive and elegant design.
