## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a mudroom that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing, with specific elements such as a shoe cabinet, a bench with storage, and a set of hooks. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary focus is on organizing shoes, outerwear, and personal accessories while maintaining an inviting and uncluttered appearance. Additional objects like a rug, mirror, and plant are considered to enhance functionality and aesthetics, but the total number of objects should not exceed 12, prioritizing dual-functionality and visual appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The mudroom is divided into several substructures based on user requirements. The Shoe Storage Area is designated for the shoe cabinet, providing ample space for organizing footwear. The Seating and Storage Area includes a bench with storage, offering a place to sit and store small items. The Hanging Area features a set of hooks for coats and accessories, ensuring easy access and organization. An Entry/Exit Pathway is also considered to facilitate smooth movement through the room.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Shoe Storage Area, a modern-style shoe cabinet made of wood, measuring 1.2 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.0 meter, is recommended. The Seating and Storage Area includes a bench with storage, designed for comfort and additional storage space. The Hanging Area features a set of sturdy hooks for coats and accessories. A contemporary metal umbrella stand is suggested for the Entry/Exit Pathway, providing a convenient spot for umbrellas. A mirror and a small plant are also recommended to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetics.

## 4. Scene Graph
The shoe cabinet is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement is chosen to maximize space efficiency and provide easy access and visibility upon entering the room. The cabinet's dimensions (1.2m x 0.4m x 1.0m) fit well along the wall, maintaining balance and proportion within the room. The placement adheres to design principles by keeping the central area open for movement and other activities.

The umbrella stand is positioned on the south wall, to the left of the shoe cabinet, facing the north wall. This location ensures the stand is easily accessible for users entering or exiting the room, without obstructing pathways or the function of other objects. The stand's small size (0.128m x 0.128m x 0.403m) allows it to fit comfortably next to the shoe cabinet, maintaining the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited width of the shoe cabinet, which could not accommodate both the plant and the umbrella stand to its left. Given the user preference for a functional mudroom with essential elements like the shoe cabinet, bench, and hooks, the plant was deemed less critical and removed. Additionally, the bench storage faced a conflict due to space constraints, leading to its removal along with the rug, basket, mirror, and hooks to prioritize the core functional elements of the mudroom. This resolution ensures the room remains functional and uncluttered, aligning with the user's primary requirements.
