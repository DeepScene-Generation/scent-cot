## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a cozy breakfast nook that emphasizes natural materials and a warm, inviting atmosphere. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a central dining table, comfortable seating, and adequate lighting. The user prefers a rustic style with natural wood and wicker elements, complemented by decorative items like pillows, a rug, and plants to enhance the cozy and natural aesthetic.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Dining Area is centered around the round kitchen table, serving as the focal point for meals. The Seating Area includes a wicker bench positioned to provide comfortable seating. The Lighting Area features a hanging woven lampshade to illuminate the dining space. Additional Decorative Areas include a small rug under the table and plants placed strategically to enhance the natural and cozy atmosphere.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Dining Area, a rustic-style round kitchen table with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 1.2 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended. The Seating Area features a wicker bench measuring 1.8 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.45 meters, providing ergonomic seating. The Lighting Area includes a bohemian-style woven lampshade with dimensions of 0.299 meters by 0.299 meters by 0.718 meters. Decorative elements include a rustic fabric pillow (0.449 meters by 0.407 meters by 0.163 meters) for added comfort on the bench, a bohemian-style rug (1.5 meters by 1.5 meters) under the table, and two modern-style plants in ceramic pots (0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.0 meters) to enhance the natural aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The kitchen table, a central element of the breakfast nook, is placed in the middle of the room to serve as the focal point. Its rustic style and natural wood color complement the cozy atmosphere. The table's central placement allows for symmetrical seating and maintains balance and proportion within the space, ensuring easy access from all sides and fostering interaction.

The wicker bench is positioned behind the kitchen table, facing the north wall. This placement provides a comfortable seating arrangement that aligns with the user's desire for a cozy nook. The bench's light brown color and rustic style complement the natural wood of the table, enhancing the room's aesthetic while serving its functional purpose as seating.

The woven lampshade is centrally placed above the kitchen table, hanging from the ceiling to provide overhead lighting. This placement ensures the lampshade is functional, aesthetically pleasing, and consistent with the user's vision for a cozy breakfast nook. The ceiling height allows the lampshade to hang comfortably without obstructing headroom.

A decorative pillow is placed on the wicker bench to enhance comfort and aesthetic appeal. Its dimensions fit well on the bench, ensuring no spatial conflicts. The earth tones of the pillow complement the light brown wicker bench and the natural wood of the table, adhering to the rustic and cozy theme.

The rug is placed under the kitchen table, centrally positioned to create a cohesive and visually appealing breakfast nook. Its size fits comfortably under the table, defining the dining area and adding warmth to the space. The multi-color element of the rug enhances the natural tones, serving a decorative function without hindering movement.

Plant 1 is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, creating a visual balance without disrupting the main breakfast nook area. It serves as a decorative element that enhances the natural, cozy atmosphere desired by the user. Plant 2 is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, balancing plant 1's placement and maintaining visual harmony. This positioning provides an aesthetic accent without crowding the primary functional area around the table and bench.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the wicker bench being too small to accommodate both decorative pillows. To resolve this, decorative_pillow_2 was removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a cozy breakfast nook with a round kitchen table, a wicker bench seat, and a hanging woven lampshade. This adjustment ensures the room's functionality and aesthetic remain intact, maintaining the desired cozy atmosphere.
