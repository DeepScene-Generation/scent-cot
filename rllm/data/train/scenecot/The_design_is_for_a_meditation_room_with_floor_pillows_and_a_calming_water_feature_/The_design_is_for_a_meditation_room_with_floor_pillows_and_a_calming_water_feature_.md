## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user aims to design a meditation room that emphasizes comfort, relaxation, and minimalism. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include floor pillows for seating, a calming water feature for ambient sound, and a minimalist shelf for storing scented candles and essential oils. The user desires a serene environment with soft lighting to maintain a relaxing atmosphere. The room should remain uncluttered to allow for free movement, focusing on movable objects like pillows and shelves, while considering built-in elements like ceiling lights and the water feature.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The central seating area is designated for floor pillows, providing a comfortable space for meditation. The south wall is reserved for the water feature, which contributes to the calming atmosphere with ambient sound. The west wall serves as the storage area, featuring a minimalist shelf for scented candles and essential oils, enhancing the room's aromatic environment. The open movement space is maintained to ensure free movement, avoiding any obstructions.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central seating area, three minimalist-style floor pillows made of cotton, each measuring 0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.2 meters, are recommended to provide comfortable seating for meditation. The water feature, with dimensions of 1.0 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.2 meters, is suggested for the south wall to enhance the room's calming ambiance. A minimalist wooden shelf, measuring 1.5 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.2 meters, is proposed for the west wall to store aromatic items. Additionally, two minimalist wax candles and a glass bottle of essential oil are recommended to be placed on the shelf, contributing to the room's serene and aromatic environment.

## 4. Scene Graph
The first floor pillow is placed in the middle of the room, facing the north wall. This central location aligns with the user's preference for a meditation room, providing an open and welcoming area suitable for meditation. The minimalist style of the pillow fits well in the central space, maintaining balance and proportion while enhancing the room's aesthetic and meditative purpose. The second floor pillow is also placed in the middle of the room, slightly to the right of the first pillow, facing the north wall. This placement maintains symmetry and offers more seating options, ensuring a balanced layout that supports the meditative purpose of the room. The third floor pillow is placed to the left of the first pillow, maintaining a consistent style and color with the existing pillows. This arrangement creates a symmetrical seating area, ensuring accessibility and comfort.

The water feature is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement allows it to serve as a central piece, enhancing the calming atmosphere intended for the meditation room. The water feature's modern style and dimensions ensure it does not interfere with the seating area, providing a stable base and distributing ambient sound evenly throughout the room. The shelf is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, providing storage space while maintaining the room's aesthetic and functional purpose. Its placement complements the existing layout without interfering with the meditation space.

Candle 1 is placed on the shelf, facing the east wall. Its small size ensures it does not interfere with the shelf's function or aesthetics, adding to the room's ambiance without disrupting the flow of space. Candle 2 is placed alongside Candle 1 on the same shelf, maintaining balance and symmetry. This positioning supports the room's aesthetic and functional goals while providing a balanced aroma spread across the room. The essential oil bottle is placed on the shelf, adjacent to Candle 2, completing the aesthetic and functional grouping of aroma-related objects. Its placement ensures easy access and enhances the room's ambiance without disrupting the existing layout.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The arrangement of objects respects the user's preferences for a calming, minimalist space, maintaining balance and symmetry while ensuring functionality and aesthetic appeal. The placement of each object aligns with design principles, providing a harmonious and serene environment suitable for meditation.

                - y_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 0.05/2 = 0.025
                - y_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 0.05/2 = 4.975
                - z_min = 1.5 - 3.0/2 + 0.1/2 = 0.05
                - z_max = 1.5 + 3.0/2 - 0.1/2 = 2.95
            - conclusion: Possible position: (0.025, 0.025, 0.025, 4.975, 0.05, 2.95)
        4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
            - calculation:
                - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.025-0.075), y(3.7877-3.7877)
                - Final coordinates: x=0.025, y=3.7877, z=0.25
            - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.025, y: 3.7877, z: 0.25
        5. reason: Collision check with other objects
            - calculation:
                - No collision detected with other objects
            - conclusion: No collision detected
        6. reason: Final position calculation
            - calculation:
                - Final position within overlap: x=0.025, y=3.7877, z=0.25
            - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.025, y: 3.7877, z: 0.25
