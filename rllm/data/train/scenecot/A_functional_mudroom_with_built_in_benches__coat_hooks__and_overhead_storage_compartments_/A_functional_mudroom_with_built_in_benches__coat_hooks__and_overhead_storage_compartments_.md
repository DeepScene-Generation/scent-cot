## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user has specified the need for a functional mudroom that includes built-in benches, coat hooks, and overhead storage compartments. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes the importance of functionality, with specific areas designated for coat hooks, seating, and storage, as well as an open space for movement. Additional elements such as a shoe rack, mirror, and umbrella stand are suggested to enhance the room's practicality and aesthetic cohesion.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The mudroom is divided into several functional substructures: the Coat Hooks Area, the Sitting Area with built-in benches, the Overhead Storage Area, and an Open Movement Area. The Coat Hooks Area is designed for hanging garments, while the Sitting Area provides seating for putting on and taking off shoes. The Overhead Storage Area is intended for organizing seasonal and infrequently used items, and the Open Movement Area ensures unobstructed flow within the room.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Coat Hooks Area, modern metal coat hooks in black are recommended for their durability and aesthetic appeal. The Sitting Area features built-in benches that are comfortable and match the room's cohesive color palette. Overhead storage compartments are suggested for the Storage Area, providing accessible organization above the benches. A shoe rack is recommended near the benches for footwear organization, while a mirror is proposed near the coat hooks for quick appearance checks. An umbrella stand is also suggested to keep wet umbrellas organized and prevent clutter.

## 4. Scene Graph
The coat hooks are placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement is essential for hanging garments and aligns with the user's vision of a functional mudroom. The coat hooks are small, measuring 0.1 meters in length, 0.02 meters in width, and 0.1 meters in height, and are positioned on the wall to maximize floor space. Their modern style and black color contrast well against a light-colored wall, offering aesthetic appeal. The placement on the east wall allows for efficient organization of other elements like benches and storage, ensuring a straightforward path from the entrance to the hooks.

The mirror is placed on the west wall, centered for aesthetic balance and facing the east wall. This placement avoids spatial conflicts with existing objects on the east wall and aligns with the user's preference for functionality by allowing users to check their appearance conveniently. The mirror's dimensions are 0.8 meters in length, 0.02 meters in width, and 1.2 meters in height, fitting well within the wall's vertical space. Functionally, this position enhances the mudroom's purpose by facilitating a final check before exiting or upon entering.

## 5. Global Check
There are no conflicts identified in the current layout. The placement of objects such as the coat hooks and mirror has been carefully considered to ensure functionality and aesthetic cohesion, with no spatial conflicts or obstructions in the room. The design principles of balance and proportion are maintained throughout the mudroom, ensuring a harmonious and practical environment.

For coat_hooks_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with east_wall
        - calculation:
            - Rotation of coat_hooks_1: 90° or 270°
