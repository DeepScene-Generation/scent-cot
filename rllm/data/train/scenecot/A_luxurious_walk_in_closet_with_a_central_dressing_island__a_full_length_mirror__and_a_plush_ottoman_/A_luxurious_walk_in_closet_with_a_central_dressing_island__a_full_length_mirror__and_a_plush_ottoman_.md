## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a luxurious walk-in closet that features a central dressing island, a full-length mirror, and a plush ottoman. The room is square-shaped, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design emphasizes luxury and elegance, with specific areas designated for different elements, including the south, north, west, and east walls, as well as the middle of the room and the ceiling. The user prioritizes essential items such as the dressing island, mirror, ottoman, lighting fixtures, and wardrobe, while also considering additional decorative and functional items to enhance the room's aesthetics and functionality.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key substructures to accommodate the user's requirements. The central area is designated for the dressing island, serving as the focal point of the room. The south wall is reserved for the full-length mirror, providing a space for outfit checks. The east wall is allocated for the wardrobe, offering additional clothing storage. The middle of the room also accommodates the plush ottoman and a side table, enhancing the seating area. The ceiling is utilized for lighting fixtures to ensure adequate illumination throughout the space.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central area, a luxurious dressing island made of high-quality wood with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.9 meters is recommended. The south wall features an elegant full-length mirror with a glass and metal frame, measuring 0.694 meters by 0.089 meters by 1.544 meters. The east wall houses a luxurious wardrobe made of wood, measuring 2.5 meters by 0.6 meters by 2.5 meters. In the middle of the room, a plush ottoman with dimensions of 0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.45 meters and a modern side table measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.6 meters are recommended. A decorative ceramic vase with dimensions of 0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.4 meters is suggested for the dressing island. The ceiling features a modern lighting fixture made of metal and glass, measuring 0.494 meters by 0.494 meters by 1.24 meters, to provide optimal illumination.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dressing island is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall, as it is the primary feature of the luxurious walk-in closet. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.9m) allow it to fit comfortably in the middle without overcrowding the space, ensuring easy access from all sides. This central placement aligns with the user's vision of a luxurious and functional closet, serving as both a functional and aesthetic focal point.

The full-length mirror is mounted on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures it is easily accessible for outfit checks and complements the central dressing island. The mirror's dimensions (0.694m x 0.089m x 1.544m) allow it to fit seamlessly against the wall, enhancing the room's functionality and luxurious appeal.

The plush ottoman is positioned adjacent to the dressing island in the middle of the room, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.8m x 0.45m) ensure it complements the island without obstructing pathways or the use of the mirror. This placement provides comfortable seating and maintains the room's open, luxurious feel.

The lighting fixture is installed on the ceiling in the middle of the room, ensuring optimal illumination for all activities in the closet. Its dimensions (0.494m x 0.494m x 1.24m) and central ceiling position provide balanced lighting, complementing the luxurious and modern theme without interfering with any existing objects.

The wardrobe is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (2.5m x 0.6m x 2.5m) allow it to fit well along the wall, optimizing space usage and providing easy access to clothing. This placement maintains balance and functionality, complementing the other luxurious elements in the room.

The vase is placed on the dressing island, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.4m) allow it to fit comfortably on the island, adding a decorative touch that enhances the room's aesthetic without overcrowding the space.

The side table is positioned to the right of the plush ottoman, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.6m) ensure it fits comfortably next to the ottoman, providing additional surface space without disrupting the flow or aesthetic of the room.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified involving the vase and the sculpture, as the width of the vase was too small to accommodate the sculpture next to it on the dressing island. To resolve this conflict, the sculpture was removed, as it was deemed less important for the user's preference and the room's functionality compared to the other elements. This decision ensured that the room maintained its luxurious and functional design without overcrowding the central dressing island.
