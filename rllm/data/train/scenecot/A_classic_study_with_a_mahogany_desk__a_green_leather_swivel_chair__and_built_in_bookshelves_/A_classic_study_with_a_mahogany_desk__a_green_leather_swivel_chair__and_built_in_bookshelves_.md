## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a classic study room characterized by a sophisticated and functional atmosphere. Key elements include a mahogany desk, a green leather swivel chair, and built-in bookshelves, all contributing to a classic aesthetic. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes the importance of functionality and aesthetics, with a preference for classic decorative items such as a globe or clock, and additional lighting to enhance the study environment.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional areas based on the user's requirements. The Mahogany Desk and Chair Area is central, providing a workspace for reading and writing. The Built-in Bookshelves Area on the north wall is designated for storing a large collection of books. The South Wall Window Area allows natural light into the room, while the Middle of the Room serves as a flexible space for movement and additional furniture placement. Each area is designed to enhance the room's classic and functional ambiance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Mahogany Desk and Chair Area, a classic mahogany desk and a green leather swivel chair are recommended to create a cohesive workspace. A classic desk lamp and a decorative globe are suggested to enhance lighting and aesthetic appeal. The Built-in Bookshelves Area features a substantial wooden bookshelf for book storage, complemented by a metal bookend for organization. A classic-style rug is proposed to define the workspace, and a side table is recommended for additional surface area. A classic gold floor lamp is suggested to provide additional lighting near the seating area.

## 4. Scene Graph
The built-in bookshelf, a key element for storing books, is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions are 4.0 meters in length, 0.4 meters in width, and 2.5 meters in height. This placement ensures the bookshelf is accessible and integrates seamlessly into the classic study design, enhancing both functionality and aesthetic appeal. The bookshelf's placement on the north wall maintains balance within the room and aligns with the user's preference for a classic study.

The bookend, a small accessory for organizing books, is placed on the built-in bookshelf. Its dimensions are 0.15 meters in length, 0.15 meters in width, and 0.2 meters in height. Positioned on a lower shelf, the bookend is easily accessible and complements the room's classic style with its metal material and black color. This placement ensures the bookend serves its organizational purpose effectively without detracting from the room's symmetry.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the north wall's inability to accommodate all intended objects, specifically the built-in bookshelf, desk, swivel chair, side table, and floor lamp. To resolve this, the side table, floor lamp, and step stool were removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a classic study with a mahogany desk, green leather swivel chair, and built-in bookshelves. This adjustment ensures the room remains functional and aesthetically aligned with the user's vision.
