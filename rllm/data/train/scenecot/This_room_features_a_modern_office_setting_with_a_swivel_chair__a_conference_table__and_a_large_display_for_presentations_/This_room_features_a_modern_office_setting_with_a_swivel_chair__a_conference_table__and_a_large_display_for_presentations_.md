## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a modern office setting within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters. The primary requirements include a swivel chair, a conference table, and a large display for presentations. The office should support a variety of functions, such as presentations, group discussions, and individual workspaces. Additional elements like a credenza for storage, a wall clock for time management, a potted plant for ambiance, and a whiteboard for brainstorming are suggested to enhance both functionality and aesthetics. The design should maintain a minimalist approach with clear sightlines, ensuring the total number of items does not exceed 13.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on user requirements. The central area is designated for group discussions, featuring the conference table and swivel chairs. The north wall serves as the presentation area, hosting the large display. The south wall is utilized for storage, with a credenza and a potted plant enhancing the ambiance. The east wall is dedicated to brainstorming activities with a whiteboard, while the west wall features a wall clock for time management. This decomposition ensures each area serves a specific purpose while maintaining a cohesive modern office environment.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central discussion area, a modern-style conference table (2.5m x 1.2m x 0.75m) and four swivel chairs (each 0.6m x 0.6m x 1.0m) are recommended to facilitate group interactions. The presentation area includes a large display (1.5m x 0.1m x 1.0m) mounted on the north wall. The storage area features a modern credenza (1.8m x 0.5m x 0.8m) on the south wall, complemented by a potted plant (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.9m) for decor. A modern wall clock (0.265m x 0.05m x 0.55m) is placed on the west wall for time management, and a whiteboard (1.2m x 0.1m x 1.0m) on the east wall supports brainstorming sessions.

## 4. Scene Graph
The conference table is a central element for group discussions, placed in the middle of the room facing the north wall. This central placement allows balanced access from all sides, facilitating easy movement and interaction during meetings. The table's dimensions (2.5m x 1.2m x 0.75m) fit well within the room, ensuring no spatial conflicts and aligning with the modern office setting. 

Swivel chairs are positioned around the conference table to enhance seating flexibility and comfort. Swivel chair 1 is placed behind the table, facing the north wall, ensuring direct visibility of the large display. Swivel chair 2 is symmetrically placed in front of the table, facing the south wall, maintaining balance and functionality. Swivel chair 3 is positioned to the right of the table, facing the west wall, while swivel chair 4 is placed to the left, facing the east wall. Each chair's dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 1.0m) ensure they fit comfortably without obstructing movement.

The large display is mounted on the north wall, facing the south wall, ensuring clear visibility for all participants seated around the table. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.1m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstruction, enhancing the room's modern aesthetic.

The credenza is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, providing storage without obstructing movement. Its dimensions (1.8m x 0.5m x 0.8m) ensure it fits well along the wall. Adjacent to the credenza, the potted plant adds a decorative touch, enhancing the room's ambiance without interfering with functionality.

The wall clock is mounted on the west wall, facing the east wall, ensuring visibility from both the conference table and the credenza. Its placement provides a visual anchor and complements the room's modern style. The whiteboard is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall, adjacent to the conference table for easy access during discussions. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.1m x 1.0m) ensure it fits comfortably without conflicting with other objects.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. Each object is positioned to ensure optimal functionality and aesthetic appeal, adhering to the user's preferences for a modern office setting. The arrangement maintains balance and proportion, with no spatial conflicts or obstructions, ensuring a cohesive and functional office environment.
