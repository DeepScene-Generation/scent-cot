## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern living room characterized by a minimalistic aesthetic. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for movement and arrangement. Key elements include a modern fabric sofa, a low wooden coffee table, and a black iron decorative lamp. The user desires a cohesive and functional design that maintains a modern and minimalist style, with additional elements like a rug, side table, bookshelf, wall art, and a plant to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Seating Area is defined by the modern fabric sofa and coffee table, providing a central zone for relaxation and social interaction. The Lighting Area is enhanced by the black iron decorative lamp, ensuring adequate illumination. The Storage Area is represented by the bookshelf, offering space for books and decorative items. The Decorative Area includes wall art and a plant, adding visual interest and a natural element to the room. Each substructure is designed to harmonize with the modern aesthetic while fulfilling specific functional needs.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a modern fabric sofa in beige (2.0m x 0.9m x 0.8m) and a low wooden coffee table (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.4m) are recommended. The Lighting Area features a black iron decorative lamp (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.5m) to provide ambient lighting. The Storage Area includes a modern white bookshelf (0.8m x 0.3m x 2.0m) for storing books. The Decorative Area is enhanced by a multicolor canvas wall art (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.7m) and a green ceramic plant (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m). A grey fabric rug (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.01m) and a wooden side table (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.6m) are also recommended to define the seating area and provide additional surface space.

## 4. Scene Graph
The modern fabric sofa is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures the sofa is inviting and functional, creating a harmonious seating arrangement. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.9m x 0.8m) fit well against the wall, maintaining balance and proportion in the room. The coffee table is positioned directly in front of the sofa, on the floor, aligning with its function as a low table. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.4m) allow for adequate circulation space, maintaining the modern aesthetic.

The black iron decorative lamp is placed on the floor to the left of the sofa, facing the north wall. Its height (1.5m) makes it suitable for illuminating the seating area, enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal. The grey fabric rug is centered in the room, under the coffee table, and in front of the sofa. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.01m) define the seating area, creating a cohesive look with the sofa and coffee table.

The wooden side table is placed right of the sofa against the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.6m) provide additional surface space without disrupting the room's layout. The modern white bookshelf is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.3m x 2.0m) ensure stability and accessibility, maintaining balance and symmetry in the room.

The multicolor canvas wall art is centered on the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.7m) enhance the visual appeal without requiring floor space. The green ceramic plant is placed on the floor against the west wall, facing the east wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) add a natural touch, complementing the room's decor.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed in a manner that respects spatial constraints and user preferences, ensuring a harmonious and functional layout. The room's modern aesthetic is maintained, with each object contributing to the overall design without causing spatial conflicts.
