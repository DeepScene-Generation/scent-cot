## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a classic gentleman's lounge characterized by luxurious and sophisticated elements. Essential components include a leather sofa, a wooden side table, and a metal ashtray, all contributing to a timeless and elegant ambiance. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for additional seating and decorative items. The user desires a space that is both functional for socializing and aesthetically pleasing, with a focus on classic design elements such as vintage art pieces and a classic rug.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The main Seating Area is centered around the leather sofa, designed for relaxation and social interaction. Adjacent to this is the Surface Area, featuring the wooden side table for convenience and functionality. The Lighting Area is intended to enhance the ambiance with classic lighting fixtures. Decorative elements are strategically placed to complement the classic theme, including a vintage art piece and a classic rug that defines the central space.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a classic leather sofa measuring 2.0 meters by 1.0 meters by 0.8 meters is recommended, complemented by a wooden side table (0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.5 meters) for the Surface Area. A metal ashtray, small and functional, is suggested for the side table. The Lighting Area initially included a classic floor lamp, but due to spatial constraints, it was removed. Decorative recommendations include a vintage art piece (1.0 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.7 meters) and a classic rug (3.0 meters by 2.0 meters) to enhance the room's aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The leather sofa is a central element in the classic gentleman's lounge, placed against the south wall facing the north wall. This placement ensures the sofa is a focal point, providing an inviting seating arrangement that aligns with the classic style. The sofa's dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.8m) fit comfortably against the wall, maintaining balance and proportion in the room.

The wooden side table is positioned to the left of the leather sofa, also against the south wall. This placement offers a functional surface for items like the metal ashtray, enhancing the classic style with its mahogany color. The side table's dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.5m) ensure it does not obstruct movement or disrupt the room's flow.

The metal ashtray is placed on the wooden side table, providing easy access for users seated on the sofa. Its small size (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.1m) allows it to fit comfortably on the table without cluttering the space, maintaining the room's aesthetic appeal.

The vintage art piece is hung on the south wall, centered above the leather sofa. This placement draws attention and enhances the aesthetic appeal of the lounge, with its dimensions (1.0m x 0.1m x 0.7m) ensuring it does not overwhelm the space.

The classic rug is placed in the middle of the room, serving as a central element that ties together the seating arrangement. Its dimensions (3.0m x 2.0m) allow it to define the seating area without interfering with the functionality of other objects, adding warmth and comfort to the lounge.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, several conflicts were identified. The floor lamp initially placed left of the armchair was repositioned to the right due to spatial constraints with the leather sofa. Additionally, the wooden side table could not accommodate all intended objects, leading to the removal of the vintage globe and cigar humidor to prioritize the metal ashtray, aligning with user preferences. The south wall was also too small to accommodate all planned objects, resulting in the removal of the armchair and floor lamp to maintain the room's classic gentleman's lounge theme.
