## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a rustic kitchen featuring a farmhouse sink, a wooden island, and metal hanging pot racks as essential elements. These components are crucial for both the functional and aesthetic aspects of the kitchen. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for these elements while ensuring comfortable movement. The user also desires additional rustic elements such as a wooden dining table with chairs, wooden shelves for storage, and an overhead light fixture to enhance the kitchen's functionality and rustic charm.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The kitchen is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Sink Area is designated for the farmhouse sink, providing a central dishwashing station. The Island Area is centered around the wooden island, serving as the main preparation and social interaction zone. The Pot Rack Area is located above the island, offering convenient access to cookware. The Dining Area is positioned near the island, providing a space for family meals. The Storage Area includes rustic wooden shelves for storing kitchen items, while the Lighting Area focuses on providing adequate illumination with an overhead light fixture.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sink Area, a rustic-style farmhouse sink made of ceramic with dimensions of 0.9 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters is recommended. The Island Area features a wooden island measuring 2.0 meters by 1.0 meters by 0.9 meters, aligning with the rustic theme. The Pot Rack Area includes a metal pot rack with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.5 meters, suspended from the ceiling. The Dining Area is equipped with a rustic wooden dining table (1.8 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.75 meters) and four matching chairs (each 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.9 meters). The Storage Area includes a wooden shelf (1.2 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.8 meters) for additional storage. The Lighting Area features an industrial-style overhead light fixture (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.4 meters) to provide functional lighting.

## 4. Scene Graph
The farmhouse sink is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement is central to the kitchen's functionality, allowing for proper plumbing installation and enhancing the rustic aesthetic with a view or good lighting. The sink's dimensions (0.9m x 0.6m x 0.4m) fit comfortably against the wall, ensuring it does not overwhelm the space.

The wooden island is centrally located in the middle of the room, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.9m) allow for ample space around it, facilitating movement and meal preparation. This central placement ensures the island is accessible from all sides, enhancing the kitchen's functionality and maintaining an open layout.

The metal pot rack is suspended from the ceiling directly above the wooden island. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.4m x 0.5m) ensure it is accessible for hanging pots and pans without obstructing movement or views. This placement complements the rustic and industrial styles, enhancing the kitchen's efficiency and aesthetic appeal.

The dining table is positioned towards the north side of the room, adjacent to the wooden island but offset to the east to avoid spatial conflict. It faces the south wall, providing a dedicated space for dining. The table's dimensions (1.8m x 0.9m x 0.75m) allow for sufficient space for chairs and movement around it.

Chair 1 and Chair 2 are placed in front of the dining table, facing the south wall, while Chair 3 is positioned behind the table, facing the north wall. Chair 4 is placed on the east side of the table, facing the west wall. Each chair measures 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.9 meters, ensuring they fit comfortably around the table, providing balanced and functional seating.

The wooden shelf is placed on the south wall, to the right of the farmhouse sink. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.3m x 1.8m) allow it to fit without overlapping the sink, providing additional storage while maintaining the rustic aesthetic.

The overhead light fixture is mounted on the ceiling above the wooden island. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.4m) ensure it provides adequate lighting without conflicting with the pot rack. This placement enhances the kitchen's functionality and complements the rustic and industrial design elements.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed considering the room's dimensions and the user's preferences, ensuring a cohesive and functional rustic kitchen design.
