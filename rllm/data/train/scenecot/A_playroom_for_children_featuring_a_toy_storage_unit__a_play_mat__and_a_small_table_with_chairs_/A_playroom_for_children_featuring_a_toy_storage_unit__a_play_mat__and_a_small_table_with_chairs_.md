## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a children's playroom that incorporates essential elements such as a toy storage unit, a play mat, and a small table with chairs. These components are crucial for the room's functionality, ensuring an organized, safe, and engaging environment for children. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for play and movement. The user emphasizes a playful and inviting atmosphere, with a preference for colorful and child-safe materials that align with the room's theme.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The playroom is divided into several key substructures to optimize functionality and aesthetics. The Toy Storage Area is designated along the south wall for organizing toys efficiently. The Play Mat Area is centrally located, serving as the primary zone for children's activities. Adjacent to the play mat is the Drawing and Snack Table Area, which includes a child-sized table and chairs for creative activities and snacks. Additionally, an Open Movement Space is maintained to ensure safe and unobstructed movement throughout the room. Decorative elements such as wall decals and ceiling fixtures enhance the room's playful ambiance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Toy Storage Area, a colorful and durable toy storage unit made of child-safe materials is recommended, measuring 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter. The Play Mat Area features a soft, colorful play mat with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 2.0 meters, providing a comfortable play surface. The Drawing and Snack Table Area includes a child-sized table (0.8 meters by 0.8 meters) and two playful plastic chairs (each 0.35 meters by 0.35 meters by 0.6 meters) to facilitate creative activities. A multicolor vinyl wall decal and a playful ceiling fixture are suggested to enhance the room's decor, while a green rug (1.5 meters by 1.5 meters) complements the play mat, expanding the play zone.

## 4. Scene Graph
The toy storage unit is a crucial element for maintaining order in the playroom. Its playful style and multicolor design align with the room's theme. Measuring 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter, it is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to maximize open play space and ensure easy access for children. This placement adheres to design principles by balancing the room's layout and maintaining functionality.

The play mat, measuring 2.0 meters by 2.0 meters, is centrally located in the room, providing a safe and accessible play area. This placement ensures the mat does not obstruct access to the toy storage unit and maintains an open and inviting atmosphere. The mat's central location enhances the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The child table, intended for drawing and snacks, is placed near the play mat, slightly towards the north wall, facing the north wall. With dimensions of 0.8 meters by 0.8 meters, it maintains a cohesive play area without causing obstruction. This placement ensures easy access and supervision, aligning with user preferences for a child-friendly environment.

Child chair 1, measuring 0.35 meters by 0.35 meters by 0.6 meters, is placed to the right of the child table, facing the west wall. This placement ensures functionality and accessibility, allowing the chair to be used effectively with the table. Child chair 2, identical in size, is placed to the left of the table, facing the east wall, maintaining balance and symmetry in the room.

The wall decal, a playful multicolor vinyl decoration, is placed on the south wall above the toy storage unit. This placement enhances the room's aesthetic without occupying floor space or interfering with functionality. The ceiling fixture, a playful yellow light, is centrally placed on the ceiling to provide uniform illumination for the play area, complementing the room's theme.

Finally, the green rug, measuring 1.5 meters by 1.5 meters, is placed adjacent to the play mat on its west side. This placement expands the play zone without overlapping the mat, maintaining balance and enhancing the room's playful atmosphere.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were strategically placed to maximize functionality and aesthetics, ensuring a safe and engaging play environment for children. The room's layout effectively accommodates all elements without spatial conflicts, adhering to the user's preferences and design principles.

For ceiling_fixture_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No other objects in proximity
        - conclusion: No directional constraint applied
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'ceiling' relation
