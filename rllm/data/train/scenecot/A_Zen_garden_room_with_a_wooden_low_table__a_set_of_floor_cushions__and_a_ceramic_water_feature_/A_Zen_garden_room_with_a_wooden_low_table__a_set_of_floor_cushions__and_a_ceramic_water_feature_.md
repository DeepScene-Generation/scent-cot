## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a Zen garden room characterized by a minimalist and calming environment, incorporating natural elements. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, is intended to support meditation, social gatherings, and unobstructed movement. Key elements include a wooden low table, a set of floor cushions, and a ceramic water feature, all arranged centrally to facilitate a serene and balanced atmosphere. The user emphasizes the importance of maintaining a minimalist aesthetic while integrating functional items like a tea set and plants to enhance the room's natural ambiance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The central Meditation Area is designed for relaxation and meditation, featuring the low table and floor cushions. The Tranquility Zone includes the ceramic water feature, enhancing the room's calming atmosphere. The Social Gathering Space is centered around the low table, facilitating tea ceremonies and interactions. Lastly, the Decor and Lighting Areas incorporate plants and a floor lamp to complement the Zen aesthetic and provide ambient lighting.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Meditation Area, a Japanese-style wooden low table (1.2m x 0.8m x 0.3m) and four Zen-style cotton floor cushions (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.1m each) are recommended to support seating and meditation. The Tranquility Zone features a ceramic water feature (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) to enhance the room's serenity. A traditional ceramic tea set (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.2m) is suggested for the Social Gathering Space, placed on the low table. Minimalist green plants (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m each) are recommended for decor, and a modern metal floor lamp (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.5m) provides lighting.

## 4. Scene Graph
The low table, a central element in the Zen garden room, is placed in the middle of the room, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.8m x 0.3m) allow it to serve as a focal point for meditation and tea ceremonies, ensuring accessibility from all sides and maintaining the room's open, minimalistic aesthetic. This central placement adheres to Zen design principles of symmetry and balance, facilitating the room's intended use.

Floor cushions are strategically placed around the low table to create a balanced seating arrangement. Floor cushion 1 is positioned in front of the table, facing the north wall, while floor cushion 2 is behind it, also facing north. Floor cushion 3 is placed to the right of the table, facing the west wall, and floor cushion 4 to the left, facing the east wall. Each cushion (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.1m) complements the Zen aesthetic, providing functional seating for meditation and tea ceremonies.

The ceramic water feature is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) and placement enhance the room's tranquility without obstructing pathways or seating arrangements. This positioning maintains visual balance and complements the central seating area.

The tea set is placed on the low table, facing the north wall. Its compact size (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.2m) fits comfortably on the table, supporting its function as a centerpiece for social gatherings and tea ceremonies, aligning with the room's Zen theme.

Plant 1 is placed on the floor to the left of the ceramic water feature, against the east wall, facing the west wall. Plant 2 is positioned on the west wall, facing the east wall, near the middle of the wall. Each plant (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) enhances the room's natural and serene atmosphere, contributing to the Zen garden theme.

The floor lamp is placed in the north-east corner of the room, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.5m) and placement provide ambient lighting to the central area without obstructing movement paths or views, maintaining the room's open and balanced layout.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the initial placement of the floor lamp, which was positioned in the north-east corner with only one wall relationship. To resolve this, the floor lamp was repositioned to maintain its corner placement by adding a relationship with the east wall, ensuring it remains a standalone feature that enhances the ambiance without interference. This adjustment ensures the floor lamp provides ample lighting while adhering to the room's Zen aesthetic and functional requirements.
