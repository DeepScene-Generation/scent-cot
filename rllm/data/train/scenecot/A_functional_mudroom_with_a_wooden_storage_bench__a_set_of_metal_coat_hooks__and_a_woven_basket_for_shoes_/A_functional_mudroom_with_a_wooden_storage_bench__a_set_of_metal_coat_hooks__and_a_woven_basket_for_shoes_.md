## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a functional mudroom with a focus on organization and a welcoming atmosphere. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for the desired elements. Key features include a wooden storage bench for seating and storage, metal coat hooks for organizing outerwear, and a woven basket for shoe storage. Additional elements such as a mirror, a small rug, and a plant are suggested to enhance both functionality and aesthetics, ensuring the space remains uncluttered and visually appealing.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The mudroom is decomposed into several functional substructures based on user requirements. The Seating and Storage Area is centered around the wooden storage bench, providing a place to sit and store items. The Hanging Area is designated for the coat hooks, ensuring outerwear is organized and easily accessible. The Shoe Storage Area is defined by the placement of the woven basket, facilitating convenient shoe storage. The Visual Check Area is enhanced by the mirror, allowing for last-minute appearance checks. Finally, the Aesthetic Enhancement Area includes the rug and plant, which add texture and a natural touch to the room.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating and Storage Area, a traditional-style wooden storage bench with dimensions of 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters is recommended. The Hanging Area features a series of industrial-style metal coat hooks, each measuring 0.181 meters by 0.311 meters by 0.782 meters, mounted on the south wall. The Shoe Storage Area includes a rustic woven basket, 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.3 meters, placed near the bench. The Visual Check Area is enhanced by a modern-style mirror, 1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 1.5 meters, on the west wall. The Aesthetic Enhancement Area includes a contemporary gray rug, 1.2 meters by 0.8 meters, and a bohemian-style plant, 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.6 meters, adding visual interest and functionality.

## 4. Scene Graph
The storage bench is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to serve as both seating and storage. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.5m x 0.5m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing movement, aligning with the user's preference for a functional mudroom. This placement respects balance and proportion, ensuring the bench is accessible and complements the room's traditional style.

The coat hooks are mounted on the south wall above the storage bench, with each hook placed to the right of the previous one. This linear arrangement ensures easy access to coats while maintaining visual balance. Each hook measures 0.181 meters by 0.311 meters by 0.782 meters, and their placement at a height of 1.5 meters from the floor ensures functionality without interfering with the bench.

The woven basket is placed on the floor to the right of the storage bench, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.4m x 0.3m) allow it to fit without obstructing pathways, providing convenient shoe storage. This placement aligns with the user's vision for a functional mudroom, complementing the natural materials in the room.

The rug is positioned in front of the storage bench, covering part of the floor space leading to the bench. Its size (1.2m x 0.8m) ensures it captures dirt effectively while maintaining an open layout. The rug's placement enhances the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal, aligning with the user's preferences.

The mirror is placed on the west wall, facing east, providing a convenient location for visual checks before exiting the room. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.5m) ensure it fits without obstructing movement, complementing the room's modern elements and enhancing its functionality.

Finally, the plant is placed on the south wall, right of the woven basket, adjacent to it. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.6m) allow it to enhance the room's aesthetic without obstructing functionality. This placement complements the existing elements, adding a natural touch to the room's design.

## 5. Global Check
There are no conflicts detected in the current layout. All objects are placed in a manner that respects spatial constraints and user preferences, ensuring a functional and aesthetically pleasing mudroom. The arrangement maintains balance and proportion, with each element contributing to the room's overall design and functionality.
