## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a chic boutique characterized by elegance and sophistication, with a focus on creating a visually appealing and functional space. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a black dress form, a glass display cabinet, and velvet hangers, all contributing to the boutique's luxurious atmosphere. The user desires distinct areas for displaying clothing and accessories, with an emphasis on a chic aesthetic and customer interaction.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Central Display Area is highlighted by the dress form, serving as the focal point for showcasing fashion pieces. The Accessory Display Cabinet is designated for smaller items, ensuring security and functionality with adjustable shelves. The Clothing Display Area features velvet hangers and a rail system for organizing garments, maintaining the boutique's elegant atmosphere. Ceiling Lighting is crucial for illuminating the space, with track lighting enhancing the ambiance. Additional elements include a Full-Length Mirror for customer interaction and a Seating Area with a bench for comfort.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Central Display Area, a chic black dress form with dimensions of 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.8 meters is recommended. The Accessory Display Cabinet, made of transparent glass, measures 1.0 meter by 0.5 meters by 2.0 meters, providing a modern display solution. The Clothing Display Area includes luxurious velvet hangers (0.161 meters by 0.161 meters by 0.776 meters) and a silver metal rail system (4.0 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.1 meters) for organizing clothing. Track lighting (2.0 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.2 meters) is installed on the ceiling for optimal illumination. A chic full-length mirror (0.8 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.8 meters) and a modern velvet bench (1.2 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.5 meters) complete the boutique's functional and aesthetic needs.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dress form is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall, to serve as the focal point of the boutique. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.8m) allow it to be viewed from all angles, enhancing its prominence and aligning with the chic aesthetic. The platform, measuring 0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.2 meters, is positioned directly beneath the dress form to elevate it, ensuring visibility and prominence.

The glass display cabinet is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.5m x 2.0m) make it a prominent feature for accessory display, complementing the central dress form and maintaining a balanced layout. The velvet hangers are arranged on the south wall, with 'hangers_1' to the right of the glass cabinet, 'hangers_2' to the right of 'hangers_1', and 'hangers_3' to the right of 'hangers_2', all facing the north wall. This arrangement creates a cohesive display area, enhancing the boutique's luxurious theme.

The rail system is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall, to maximize clothing organization and maintain aesthetic harmony. The track light is centrally positioned on the ceiling, providing optimal lighting coverage across the boutique. The full-length mirror is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall, allowing customers to view themselves without obstruction. Finally, the bench is placed in the middle of the room, facing the north wall, offering seating for customers and complementing the boutique's chic aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the initial placement of 'hangers_2', which could not be positioned left of 'hangers_1' due to the presence of the glass cabinet. To resolve this, 'hangers_2' was repositioned to the right of 'hangers_1', maintaining adjacency and creating a continuous display area. This adjustment ensured no spatial conflicts and preserved the boutique's cohesive and elegant design.
