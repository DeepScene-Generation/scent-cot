## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user has requested a home laboratory setup within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary requirements include a sturdy lab bench and chemical storage cabinets, emphasizing a functional and safe environment for conducting experiments. The user desires a professional and organized appearance, with a focus on efficient workflow, safe chemical storage, and the ability to organize equipment effectively. The laboratory should also accommodate temporary setups, ensuring that the total number of objects does not exceed 14, prioritizing functionality and safety.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Lab Bench Area is designated for conducting experiments and includes a lab bench and stool. The Chemical Storage Area is intended for storing chemicals safely, featuring chemical cabinets and safety equipment like a fire extinguisher. The Equipment Organization Area focuses on organizing lab equipment with trays and bins. The Open Middle Area is reserved for temporary setups, utilizing a utility cart for mobility and flexibility.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Lab Bench Area, an industrial-style metal lab bench (2.0m x 0.8m x 0.9m) and a matching lab stool (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.6m) are recommended to facilitate experiments. The Chemical Storage Area includes two industrial-style metal chemical cabinets (1.2m x 0.5m x 2.0m each) and a fire extinguisher (0.241m x 0.292m x 0.561m) for safety. The Equipment Organization Area features two plastic equipment trays (0.5m x 0.4m x 0.1m each) for organizing lab items. The Open Middle Area is equipped with a metal utility cart (0.8m x 0.5m x 0.9m) for temporary setups.

## 4. Scene Graph
The lab bench, identified as lab_bench_1, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This central placement facilitates efficient workflow and access to other components, such as the chemical storage cabinets. The bench's industrial style and metal material align with its functionality for conducting experiments, ensuring it remains a prominent feature in the room. The lab stool is positioned in front of the lab bench, centered to allow comfortable seating and efficient use of space. Its dimensions ensure it fits without obstructing movement, enhancing the lab's usability.

The first chemical cabinet is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, ensuring proximity to the lab bench for easy access during experiments. This placement maintains stability and safety, especially when storing hazardous materials. The second chemical cabinet is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, maintaining symmetry and functionality without obstructing the lab bench or stool. The fire extinguisher is placed on the south wall, adjacent to the second chemical cabinet, ensuring visibility and accessibility in case of emergencies.

The equipment trays are placed on the lab bench, adjacent to each other, facing the south wall. This arrangement ensures easy access to organized equipment during experiments, maintaining a functional and efficient workspace. The utility cart is placed on the north wall, left of the lab bench, facing the south wall. This placement ensures accessibility for temporary setups without blocking primary pathways, enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The layout ensures that all objects are positioned to maximize functionality and safety, adhering to the user's preferences and design principles. The room remains organized and efficient, with all objects accessible and no spatial conflicts present.
