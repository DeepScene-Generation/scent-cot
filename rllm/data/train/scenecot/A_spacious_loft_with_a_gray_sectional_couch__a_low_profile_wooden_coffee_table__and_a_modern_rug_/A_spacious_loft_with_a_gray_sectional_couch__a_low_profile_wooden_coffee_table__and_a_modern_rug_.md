## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a spacious loft with a modern aesthetic, characterized by a gray sectional couch, a wooden coffee table, and a modern rug. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for relaxation and socializing. The user emphasizes the need for a modern style while maintaining an open and inviting atmosphere. Essential elements include the sectional couch, coffee table, and rug, with additional recommendations for a floor lamp, decorative cushions, a side table, an art piece, and a bookshelf to enhance functionality and aesthetics.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to optimize its functionality and aesthetic appeal. The 'Sectional Couch Area' serves as the primary seating zone, providing comfort and a focal point for social interaction. The 'Wooden Coffee Table Area' is positioned to facilitate easy access to drinks and items for those seated. The 'Open Movement Area' ensures the room remains spacious and navigable. Additional substructures include a 'Lighting Area' for ambient illumination, a 'Decorative Area' for visual interest, and a 'Storage and Display Area' for organization and showcasing items.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the 'Sectional Couch Area', a modern gray sectional couch measuring 3.0 meters by 2.0 meters by 0.9 meters is recommended. The 'Wooden Coffee Table Area' features a modern wooden coffee table with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters. A modern rug, measuring 3.0 meters by 2.0 meters, is suggested to define the seating area. A modern floor lamp, 1.8 meters in height, is proposed for the 'Lighting Area'. Decorative cushions, each 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters, are recommended to enhance comfort and aesthetics. An art piece, 1.0 meter by 0.1 meter by 1.0 meter, is suggested for the 'Decorative Area', while a modern bookshelf, 1.2 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.8 meters, is recommended for the 'Storage and Display Area'.

## 4. Scene Graph
The sectional couch is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, serving as the room's focal point. Its dimensions (3.0m x 2.0m x 0.9m) ensure it provides ample seating while maintaining an open space. This placement aligns with the user's preference for a spacious loft, optimizing seating arrangement and space usage.

The coffee table is positioned in front of the sectional couch, centrally aligned to maintain balance within the space. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.4m) allow it to fit comfortably without disrupting the room's spacious feel. This placement ensures functionality and complements the modern aesthetic.

The rug is placed under the coffee table, extending slightly beyond it to define the seating area. Its size (3.0m x 2.0m) is appropriate for the space, enhancing the room's aesthetic while providing texture and definition.

The floor lamp is placed at the corner of the sectional couch near the south wall, providing lighting for the seating area. Its height (1.8m) ensures it does not obstruct the view or traffic flow, maintaining the room's open and modern aesthetic.

Decorative cushions are placed on the sectional couch, enhancing comfort and aesthetics. Their dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m) ensure they do not create spatial conflicts, adding a modern touch that aligns with the existing decor.

The art piece is placed on the north wall, ensuring it is visible from the sectional couch and contributes to the room's modern aesthetic. Its size (1.0m x 0.1m x 1.0m) is suitable for the available wall space, enhancing visual interest without causing spatial conflicts.

The bookshelf is placed against the east wall, maintaining the open and spacious feel of the loft. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.4m x 1.8m) fit comfortably without interfering with other objects, providing storage and display functionality.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the south wall being too small to accommodate all intended objects, including the sectional couch, rug, coffee table, side table, and floor lamp. To resolve this, the side table was removed, as it was deemed the least important for maintaining the user's preference for a spacious loft with essential elements like the sectional couch, coffee table, and rug. This adjustment ensures the room remains open and functional, adhering to the user's vision.
