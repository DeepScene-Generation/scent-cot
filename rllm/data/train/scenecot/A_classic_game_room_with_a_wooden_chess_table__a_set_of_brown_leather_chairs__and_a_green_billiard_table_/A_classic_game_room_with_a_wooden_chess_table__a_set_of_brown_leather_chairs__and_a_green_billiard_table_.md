## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a classic game room that combines functionality with aesthetic appeal, featuring a wooden chess table, brown leather chairs, and a green billiard table. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, is designed to accommodate strategic board games and billiard games, emphasizing social gatherings. The ambiance is intended to be classic and inviting, with a focus on comfortable seating and ample space for movement around the billiard table.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into two main substructures: the Chess Area and the Billiard Area. The Chess Area is centrally located, featuring a wooden chess table surrounded by leather chairs, designed for strategic board games and social interaction. The Billiard Area is positioned separately to provide ample space for playing billiards, ensuring stability and accessibility for the billiard table and related accessories.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Chess Area, a classic wooden chess table and four brown leather chairs are recommended to create a functional and aesthetically pleasing setup. A side table is suggested for convenience, along with a floor lamp to provide adequate lighting. In the Billiard Area, a green billiard table is the focal point, complemented by a cue rack and spectator seating to enhance functionality. Wall sconces are recommended to provide ambient lighting, maintaining the classic style of the room.

## 4. Scene Graph
The chess table, measuring 1.0m x 1.0m x 0.8m, is placed centrally in the room to act as the focal point, allowing players to sit comfortably around it. This central placement aligns with traditional game room designs and ensures easy access from all sides. The leather chairs, each measuring 0.6m x 0.6m x 0.9m, are strategically placed around the chess table to provide seating for players. Leather chair 1 is positioned in front of the chess table, facing the south wall, while leather chair 2 is placed behind it, facing the north wall. Leather chairs 3 and 4 are placed to the left and right of the chess table, facing the east and west walls, respectively, ensuring a balanced and functional seating arrangement.

The floor lamp, with dimensions of 0.3m x 0.3m x 1.8m, is placed to the left of leather chair 3, providing essential lighting for the chess area without obstructing movement. The wall sconce 2, measuring 0.2m x 0.1m x 0.3m, is mounted on the north wall, facing the south wall, to provide balanced lighting for the room. The billiard table, initially intended for the south wall, was removed due to spatial constraints, prioritizing the chess area and maintaining the classic aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the placement of spectator seat 2, which was initially positioned behind the billiard table, leading to an out-of-bounds error. To resolve this, spectator seat 2 was repositioned to the right of the billiard table, ensuring it remains adjacent and accessible for viewing games. Additionally, due to the limited space on the south wall, the cue rack was removed to prioritize the billiard table and seating arrangements, aligning with the user's preference for a classic game room centered around the chess and billiard areas.
