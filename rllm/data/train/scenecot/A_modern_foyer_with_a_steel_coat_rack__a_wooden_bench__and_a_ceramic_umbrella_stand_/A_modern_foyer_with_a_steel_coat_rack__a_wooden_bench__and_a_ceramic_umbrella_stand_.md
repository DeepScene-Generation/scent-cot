## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern foyer that combines functionality with a minimalist aesthetic. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for the desired elements. Key items include a steel coat rack, a wooden bench, and a ceramic umbrella stand, which are essential for storage, seating, and organization. The user also expressed interest in additional objects such as a mirror, a console table, and a pendant light to enhance the foyer's functionality and modern style.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The foyer is divided into functional zones to optimize space and maintain a modern aesthetic. The Entry Zone includes the coat rack, bench, and umbrella stand, facilitating easy access for guests. The Reflection Zone features a mirror to enhance light and openness. The Storage Zone includes a console table for organizing small items. Finally, the Lighting Zone is defined by a centrally placed pendant light to provide balanced illumination.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Entry Zone, a modern steel coat rack (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.8m), a wooden bench (1.2m x 0.4m x 0.45m), and a ceramic umbrella stand (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) are recommended. The Reflection Zone includes a modern glass mirror (0.741m x 0.028m x 1.76m). The Storage Zone features a modern black wooden console table (1.0m x 0.3m x 0.8m). The Lighting Zone is enhanced by a modern metal pendant light (0.161m x 0.161m x 0.776m). Additionally, a plant in a ceramic pot (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.9m) is suggested to add a natural element.

## 4. Scene Graph
The coat rack is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall, to provide easy access for hanging coats as guests enter. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.8m) allow it to fit comfortably without overcrowding the space, maintaining the modern aesthetic. The placement ensures functionality and complements the foyer's design principles.

The bench is positioned on the east wall, adjacent to the coat rack, facing the west wall. This placement allows guests to sit while putting on or taking off shoes, enhancing the foyer's functionality. The bench's dimensions (1.2m x 0.4m x 0.45m) ensure it fits well alongside the coat rack, maintaining balance and proportion.

The umbrella stand is placed on the east wall, left of the coat rack, facing the west wall. Its compact size (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) allows it to fit between the coat rack and bench without causing congestion. This placement ensures easy access for storing umbrellas and aligns with the modern aesthetic.

The mirror is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall, providing a reflective surface that enhances the room's openness. Its height (1.76m) is ideal for viewing at eye level, and its minimal width (0.741m) ensures it doesn't take up excessive space, maintaining the modern style.

The console table is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall, adjacent to the mirror. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.3m x 0.8m) allow it to hold items without interfering with other objects. The placement complements the mirror, creating a cohesive look and enhancing the room's functionality.

The pendant light is centrally placed, hanging from the ceiling, to provide balanced lighting across the room. Its dimensions (0.161m x 0.161m x 0.776m) ensure it doesn't impede headspace clearance, aligning with the modern aesthetic and illuminating the foyer effectively.

The plant is placed on the floor against the north wall, slightly left of the console table, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.9m) ensure it doesn't obstruct foot traffic, adding aesthetic value and balance to the overall layout.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited length of the east wall, which could not accommodate all the intended objects. The shoe rack was identified as the least critical item for the user's preference and room functionality. To resolve this, the shoe rack was removed, ensuring the remaining objects fit comfortably and maintain the modern aesthetic of the foyer.
