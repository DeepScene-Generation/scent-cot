## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a compact home gym that includes essential elements such as a stationary bike, a rubber mat, and a metal water bottle. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes the need for a functional and aesthetically pleasing space, suggesting up to 13 objects to enhance the gym's utility and style. Key elements include a modern design for the stationary bike, a durable rubber mat for floor exercises, and a convenient placement for the water bottle. Additional recommendations include a mirror for visual expansion, a towel rack for organization, a storage unit for equipment, and a modern light fixture for proper illumination.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional areas based on user requirements. The South Wall Area is designated for the stationary bike, providing a sturdy backdrop and maximizing open space. The Middle Area is reserved for the rubber mat, offering a central location for floor exercises. The North Wall Area is intended for a mirror to enhance visual space and assist with form checks. The East Wall Area accommodates a storage unit for gym equipment, while the South Wall also hosts a towel rack for convenience. The Ceiling Area is designated for a light fixture to ensure even lighting throughout the gym.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the South Wall Area, a modern stationary bike with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.2 meters is recommended for cardio workouts. The Middle Area features a minimalist rubber mat measuring 2.0 meters by 1.0 meters by 0.02 meters for floor exercises. A modern metal water bottle, 0.08 meters by 0.08 meters by 0.25 meters, is suggested for hydration, placed near the bike. The North Wall Area includes a modern glass mirror, 1.5 meters by 0.05 meters by 2.0 meters, for visual expansion. A modern metal towel rack, 0.6 meters by 0.2 meters by 1.0 meters, is recommended for the South Wall. The East Wall Area features a modern wooden storage unit, 1.0 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.8 meters, for storing gym equipment. Finally, a modern metal light fixture, 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.2 meters, is recommended for the Ceiling Area to provide optimal lighting.

## 4. Scene Graph
The stationary bike is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures ease of access and safety, aligning with user preferences for a compact home gym setup. The bike's dimensions (1.2m x 0.6m x 1.2m) allow it to fit comfortably, leaving ample space for other gym accessories and movement. The rubber mat is placed on the floor in the middle of the room, adjacent to the stationary bike. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.02m) ensure it does not interfere with the bike, providing a dedicated space for floor exercises. The metal water bottle is placed on the stationary bike's handlebars, ensuring easy access during workouts. Its small size (0.08m x 0.08m x 0.25m) ensures it does not interfere with the bike or mat. The mirror is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.05m x 2.0m) allow it to enhance the visual space without interfering with other objects. The towel rack is placed on the south wall, next to the stationary bike, ensuring convenient access to towels. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.2m x 1.0m) ensure it does not obstruct movement. The storage unit is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.5m x 0.8m) allow it to store equipment without obstructing movement. The light fixture is placed on the ceiling in the middle of the room, facing downward. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.2m) ensure it provides optimal lighting without interfering with other objects.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. Each object was placed with consideration of spatial relationships and user preferences, ensuring a functional and aesthetically pleasing home gym setup.
