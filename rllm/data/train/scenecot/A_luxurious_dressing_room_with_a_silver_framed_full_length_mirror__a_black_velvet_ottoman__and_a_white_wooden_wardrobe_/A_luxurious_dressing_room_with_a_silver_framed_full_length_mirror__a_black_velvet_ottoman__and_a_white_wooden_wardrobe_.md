## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a luxurious dressing room that emphasizes both elegance and functionality. Key elements include a full-length mirror, an ottoman, and a wardrobe, with a focus on maintaining a spacious and open feel. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user desires a luxurious aesthetic, incorporating elements such as a chandelier for lighting, a dressing table with a stool, and decorative items to enhance the room's elegance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Wardrobe Area is designated for clothing storage, ensuring luxury and accessibility. The Seating Area, centered around a black velvet ottoman, provides comfort and elegance. The Mirror Area is crucial for dressing and viewing, featuring a silver-framed full-length mirror. The Open Space is maintained for movement, avoiding overcrowding. Additional elements include a Lighting Area with a chandelier and a Dressing Area with a table and stool, enhancing both functionality and luxury.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Wardrobe Area, a grand white wooden wardrobe is recommended, measuring 2.0 meters by 0.6 meters by 2.5 meters. The Seating Area features a black velvet ottoman (1.0 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.45 meters) for comfort. The Mirror Area includes a silver-framed full-length mirror (0.694 meters by 0.089 meters by 1.544 meters). A luxurious gold crystal chandelier (0.494 meters by 0.494 meters by 1.24 meters) is suggested for the Lighting Area. The Dressing Area includes a white wooden dressing table (1.2 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.75 meters) with a black velvet stool (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.45 meters). A small silver ceramic decor piece (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.4 meters) and a white wooden side table (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.6 meters) are recommended for additional elegance and functionality.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wardrobe, a central piece in the dressing room, is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.6m x 2.5m) make it a significant element, serving as an anchor for the room's layout. This placement maximizes visibility and accessibility, aligning with the luxurious theme and ensuring the wardrobe is a focal point upon entering the room.

The ottoman is positioned in the middle of the room, in front of the wardrobe, facing the north wall. This central placement (1.0m x 0.5m x 0.45m) ensures easy access to the wardrobe and maintains balance within the room. It enhances functionality by providing a convenient seating option without obstructing the wardrobe doors.

The mirror is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (0.694m x 0.089m x 1.544m) allow it to provide a full view of the room, complementing the wardrobe and ottoman. This placement ensures the mirror is easily accessible for full-length viewing, enhancing the luxurious aesthetic.

The chandelier is centrally located on the ceiling, ensuring even lighting distribution throughout the room. Its size (0.494m x 0.494m x 1.24m) is suitable for the room's height, adding grandeur and elegance without interfering with floor or wall objects.

The dressing table is placed against the north wall, facing south. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.5m x 0.75m) allow it to complement the wardrobe and provide a functional dressing area. This placement ensures ease of use with the mirror on the east wall, maintaining the room's luxurious ambiance.

The stool is positioned to the right of the dressing table, facing the south wall. Its size (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.45m) ensures it fits comfortably without obstructing movement or the view of the mirror. This placement enhances functionality and maintains the luxurious theme.

The decor piece is placed on the dressing table, adding a touch of elegance without obstructing its use. Its small size (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.4m) fits well on the table, enhancing the dressing area's appeal.

The side table is placed to the left of the ottoman, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.6m) allow it to fit comfortably next to the ottoman, providing a convenient surface for accessories while maintaining balance and functionality in the room.
