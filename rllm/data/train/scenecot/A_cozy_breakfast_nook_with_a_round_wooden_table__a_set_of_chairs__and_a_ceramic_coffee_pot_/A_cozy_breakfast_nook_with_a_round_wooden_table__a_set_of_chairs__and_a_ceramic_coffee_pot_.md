## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a cozy breakfast nook characterized by a round wooden table, a set of chairs, and a ceramic coffee pot. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The east wall features a window that provides natural light and a garden view, which is a significant aspect of the room's ambiance. The user desires a rustic aesthetic, emphasizing comfort and functionality, with the breakfast nook serving as a central gathering space. Additional elements such as a rug, a wall-mounted light fixture, and a sideboard are considered to enhance the room's warmth and practicality.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The central area is designated for the round wooden table and chairs, forming the core of the breakfast nook. The east wall, with its window, serves as a source of natural light and a visual connection to the garden. A coffee-making area is integrated into the central zone, featuring the ceramic coffee pot. The south wall is reserved for a sideboard, providing storage for breakfast items. The ceiling is utilized for a modern light fixture to balance natural and artificial lighting, enhancing the cozy atmosphere.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central area, a rustic round wooden table with dimensions of 1.2 meters in diameter and 0.75 meters in height is recommended, accompanied by four matching rustic wooden chairs, each measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.9 meters. A ceramic coffee pot, small in size, is suggested for the table to enhance the coffee-making area. A cozy beige rug, 2.0 meters by 2.0 meters, is proposed to define the dining space and add comfort. A modern silver light fixture, 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.2 meters, is recommended for the ceiling to provide balanced lighting. Finally, a rustic wooden sideboard, measuring 1.0 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.9 meters, is suggested for the south wall to offer additional storage.

## 4. Scene Graph
The round wooden table is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall. This central position ensures accessibility from all sides, aligning with the user's vision of a cozy breakfast nook. The table's rustic style complements the desired aesthetic, and its placement allows for the addition of chairs and a coffee pot, enhancing functionality and visual appeal.

Chair_1 is positioned to the right of the round table, facing the west wall. This placement ensures the chair is adjacent to the table, aligning with the user's vision of a cozy breakfast nook. The rustic style of the chair complements the table, enhancing the cozy theme and ensuring ease of access and visual appeal.

Chair_2 is placed to the left of the round table, facing the east wall. This symmetrical arrangement with Chair_1 provides balanced seating around the table, supporting the function of a dining space and maintaining the cozy atmosphere.

Chair_3 is positioned in front of the round table, facing the south wall. This placement maintains balance and symmetry, encouraging interaction and enhancing the breakfast nook's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

Chair_4 is placed behind the round table, facing the north wall. This completes the seating arrangement, ensuring symmetry and functionality, and aligns with the user's vision of a cozy breakfast nook.

The ceramic coffee pot is placed on the round table, centrally located for ease of use. Its small size ensures it does not interfere with the seating arrangement, enhancing both the functionality and aesthetic appeal of the breakfast nook.

The rug is placed under the round table and chairs, defining the dining area and adding comfort. Its size accommodates the chairs even when pulled out slightly, creating a cohesive look and aligning with the user's preference for a cozy nook.

The light fixture is mounted on the ceiling directly above the round table, providing balanced lighting for the breakfast nook. Its modern style complements the rustic furniture without clashing, enhancing visibility and adding a contemporary touch.

The sideboard is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement maintains the room's flow and complements the existing rustic theme, providing additional storage and functionality.

## 5. Global Check

            - rug_1 size: length=2.0, width=2.0, height=0.01
            - Room size: 5.0x5.0x3.0
            - x_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 2.0/2 = 1.0
            - x_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 2.0/2 = 4.0
            - y_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 2.0/2 = 1.0
            - y_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 2.0/2 = 4.0
            - z_min = z_max = 0.01/2 = 0.005
        - conclusion: Possible position: (1.0, 4.0, 1.0, 4.0, 0.005, 0.005)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(1.0-4.0), y(1.0-4.0)
            - Final coordinates: x=1.9407, y=1.2776, z=0.005
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 1.9407, y: 1.2776, z: 0.005
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Final coordinates: x=1.9407, y=1.2776, z=0.005
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 1.9407, y: 1.2776, z: 0.005

For sideboard_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with south_wall
        - calculation:
            - Rotation of sideboard_1: 0.0°
            - Rotation of south_wall: 0.0°
            - Rotation difference: |0.0 - 0.0| = 0.0°
        - conclusion: Using length dimension for directional constraint
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'on' relation
        - calculation:
            - sideboard_1 size: 1.0 (length)
            - Cluster size (on): max(0.0, 1.0) = 1.0
        - conclusion: sideboard_1 cluster size (on): 1.0
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'south_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - sideboard_1 size: length=1.0, width=0.4, height=0.9
            - South_wall size: length=5.0, width=0.0, height=3.0
            - x_min = 2.5 + -1 * 5.0/2 + 1 * 1.0/2 = 0.5
            - x_max = 2.5 + 1 * 5.0/2 + -1 * 1.0/2 = 4.5
            - y_min = 0 + 1 * 0.0/2 + 1 * 0.4/2 = 0.2
            - y_max = 0 + 1 * 0.0/2 + 1 * 0.4/2 = 0.2
            - z_min = z_max = 0.9/2 = 0.45
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.5, 4.5, 0.2, 0.2, 0.45, 0.45)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.5-4.5), y(0.2-0.2)
            - Final coordinates: x=3.1784, y=0.2, z=0.45
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 3.1784, y: 0.2, z: 0.45
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Final coordinates: x=3.1784, y=0.2, z=0.45
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 3.1784, y: 0.2, z: 0.45
