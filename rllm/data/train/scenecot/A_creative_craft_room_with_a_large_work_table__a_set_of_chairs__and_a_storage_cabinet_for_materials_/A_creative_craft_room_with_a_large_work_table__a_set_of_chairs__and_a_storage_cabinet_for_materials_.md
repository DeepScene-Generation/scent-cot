## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a creative craft room that emphasizes functionality and aesthetics. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a large work table as the central piece, a set of chairs for collaborative crafting, and a storage cabinet for organizing craft supplies. The user desires a space that allows for flexibility and movement, with an open area to accommodate various project setups. Additional elements such as task lighting, a crafting mat, and decorative items are considered to enhance the room's functionality and inspire creativity.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main substructures: the Central Work Area, the Storage Area, and the Open Space. The Central Work Area is designed to house the large work table and chairs, serving as the focal point for crafting activities. The Storage Area is designated for a cabinet to organize and store craft supplies, ensuring materials are easily accessible. The Open Space is intended to provide flexibility and adaptability, allowing for different project setups and ensuring movement around the work table.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Central Work Area, a modern wooden work table measuring 2.0 meters by 1.2 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended, accompanied by a set of four modern metal and fabric chairs, each measuring 0.7 meters by 0.535 meters by 0.801 meters. The Storage Area features a modern wooden cabinet with dimensions of 1.08 meters by 0.395 meters by 1.065 meters, designed to store craft supplies efficiently. A functional rubber crafting mat (1.8 meters by 1.2 meters) is suggested for the work table to protect and organize the workspace. A task lamp is considered for focused lighting, and a decorative sculpture is proposed to inspire creativity.

## 4. Scene Graph
The work table is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall, to serve as the main crafting area. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.2m x 0.75m) allow it to be the focal point, providing accessibility from all sides for collaborative work. This central placement aligns with the user's vision of a creative craft space, ensuring balance and functionality.

Chair_1 is positioned to the left of the work table, facing the east wall. This placement allows for convenient seating and interaction with the table, maintaining balance and symmetry in the room. Chair_2 is placed to the right of the work table, facing the west wall, complementing the arrangement and ensuring easy access for crafting activities. Chair_3 is positioned in front of the work table, facing the south wall, completing the set of chairs and maintaining accessibility. Chair_4 is placed behind the work table, facing the north wall, ensuring each side of the table is accessible for crafting.

The storage cabinet is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (1.08m x 0.395m x 1.065m) fit comfortably against the wall, providing easy access to craft supplies without obstructing movement. The crafting mat is centrally placed on the work table, facing the north wall, enhancing the crafting capabilities and maintaining balance.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified regarding the placement of multiple objects on the work table, specifically the task lamp, crafting mat, and decorative sculpture. The table's surface area was insufficient to accommodate all these items simultaneously. To resolve this, the decorative sculpture was removed, as it was deemed less critical to the room's functionality compared to the task lamp and crafting mat. This adjustment ensures the room maintains its intended functionality and aesthetic appeal, aligning with the user's preference for a creative craft room.
