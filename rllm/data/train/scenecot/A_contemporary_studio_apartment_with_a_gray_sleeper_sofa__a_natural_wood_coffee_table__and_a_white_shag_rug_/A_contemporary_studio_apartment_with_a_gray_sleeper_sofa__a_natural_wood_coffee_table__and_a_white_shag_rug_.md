## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a contemporary studio apartment featuring a gray sleeper sofa, a natural wood coffee table, and a white shag rug. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user's preferences lean towards a minimalist style, emphasizing functionality and aesthetic appeal. Key elements include maintaining an open floor area for ergonomic movement and utilizing the south wall window for natural lighting. The user also desires dual-purpose objects to enhance the room's ambiance without cluttering the space.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key areas based on user requirements. The Gray Sleeper Sofa Area is essential for seating and sleeping, located against the south wall. The Coffee Table and Rug Area serves as the central zone for casual dining and relaxation, positioned in the middle of the room. The Open Floor Area is crucial for maintaining a minimalist aesthetic and ensuring free movement. The South Wall Window is a significant source of natural light, enhancing the room's ambiance without additional window treatments.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Gray Sleeper Sofa Area, a gray sleeper sofa is recommended, complemented by decorative cushions and a throw blanket for added comfort and style. The Coffee Table and Rug Area features a natural wood coffee table and a white shag rug, with additional decor like a decorative vase to complete the setup. The Open Floor Area remains uncluttered to support ergonomic movement. A floor lamp is suggested for soft lighting, and a wall-mounted shelf provides additional storage without occupying floor space.

## 4. Scene Graph
The gray sleeper sofa is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to maximize seating and sleeping functionality while maintaining a contemporary aesthetic. Its dimensions are 2.0 meters in length, 0.9 meters in width, and 0.8 meters in height. This placement ensures a clear view of the room and complements the overall layout, allowing space for a coffee table and rug in front.

The coffee table, measuring 1.2 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters, is positioned in front of the sleeper sofa, centrally between the sofa and the middle of the room. This placement provides easy access for dining and relaxation, aligning with the user's contemporary style preference. The natural wood color complements the gray sofa, enhancing the room's aesthetic.

The white shag rug, with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters by 0.05 meters, is placed beneath the coffee table, enhancing comfort and aesthetic appeal. This placement aligns with the user's preference for a contemporary studio look, providing a soft texture and color contrast to the room.

A decorative vase, measuring 0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.3 meters, is placed on the coffee table, adding decorative value without hindering functionality. Its white color complements the rug and enhances the visual appeal of the coffee table area.

The floor lamp, with a base of 0.4 meters and a height of 1.8 meters, is placed to the left of the sleeper sofa, facing the north wall. This positioning provides adequate lighting for the sofa area while maintaining the room's openness and modern style.

The wall shelf, measuring 1.0 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.3 meters, is mounted on the north wall, facing the south wall. This location ensures it is visible and accessible from the main seating area, enhancing both functionality and the room's overall aesthetic appeal.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose regarding the placement of multiple objects on the sleeper sofa, which was too small to accommodate all the decorative items. The conflict involved decorative cushions and a throw blanket. To resolve this, the decorative cushions were removed, prioritizing the throw blanket for its dual purpose of providing warmth and decor. This decision aligns with the user's preference for a contemporary studio apartment with a focus on essential and impactful objects.
