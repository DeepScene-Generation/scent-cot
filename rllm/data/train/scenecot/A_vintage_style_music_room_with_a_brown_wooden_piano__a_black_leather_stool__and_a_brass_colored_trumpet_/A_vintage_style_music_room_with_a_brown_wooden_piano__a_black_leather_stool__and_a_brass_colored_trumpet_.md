## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a vintage-style music room that prominently features a piano, a stool, and a trumpet. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters. The design should incorporate elements such as the south wall, north wall, and a central area, with a total of 8 to 9 objects that enhance both functionality and aesthetics. The user emphasizes the importance of maintaining a vintage aesthetic while ensuring the room is functional for music practice and enjoyment.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key areas based on the user's requirements. The Piano Area is central, featuring the piano and stool, and includes a music stand for sheet music. The Trumpet Display Area requires a small table to hold the trumpet, maintaining proximity to the piano. The north wall is designated for memorabilia display, featuring music notes and vintage posters, with a shelf to support this function. The Seating Area provides comfort for music enjoyment, with a vintage-style armchair, side table, and lamp for ambient lighting. A vintage-style rug in the middle of the room unifies the design and adds warmth.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Piano Area, a vintage-style brown wooden piano (1.5m x 0.6m x 1.2m) is recommended, accompanied by a black leather stool (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.6m) and a metal music stand (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.2m). The Trumpet Display Area includes a vintage-style wooden table (0.6m x 0.4m x 0.5m) for the trumpet. The Memorabilia Display Area features a vintage-style wooden shelf (1.0m x 0.3m x 0.8m) for displaying items. The Seating Area includes a vintage-style armchair, a wooden side table, and a brass-colored lamp, although these were ultimately removed due to spatial constraints. A red vintage-style rug (3.0m x 2.0m) is placed in the center to enhance the room's aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The piano is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, as it is the central element of the room. This placement optimizes acoustics by reflecting sound off the wall and provides the pianist with a view of the room. The piano's dimensions (1.5m x 0.6m x 1.2m) fit comfortably against the wall, leaving space for other objects. The stool is positioned directly in front of the piano, facing the south wall, ensuring it serves its function as a seating area for the pianist. The music stand is placed to the right of the piano on the south wall, facing the north wall, allowing easy access to sheet music. The trumpet table is positioned between the stool and music stand on the south wall, maintaining a cohesive musical theme. The shelf is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, providing a balanced layout and easy access for displaying memorabilia. The rug is centrally placed in the room, providing a focal point that enhances the vintage aesthetic and complements the existing furnishings.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to the limited space on the south wall, which could not accommodate all intended objects. The side table, armchair, and lamp were removed to resolve these conflicts, as they were deemed less essential compared to the piano, stool, and trumpet table. This decision ensured the room maintained its vintage aesthetic and functionality without overcrowding the space.
