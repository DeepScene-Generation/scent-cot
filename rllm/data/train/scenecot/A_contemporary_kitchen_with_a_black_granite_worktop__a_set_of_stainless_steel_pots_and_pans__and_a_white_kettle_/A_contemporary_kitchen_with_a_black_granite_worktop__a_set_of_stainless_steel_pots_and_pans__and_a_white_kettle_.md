## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a contemporary kitchen with specific elements such as a black granite worktop, stainless steel pots and pans, and a white kettle. The kitchen measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key requirements include a preparation area, storage space, easy-to-clean surfaces, and an open central area for movement. The user desires a modern aesthetic with a cohesive look, emphasizing functionality and easy maintenance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The kitchen is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Preparation Area is centered around the black granite worktop, serving as the main zone for food preparation. The Storage Area includes sleek, modern racks or cabinets for pots and pans, ensuring efficiency and visual appeal. Easy-to-clean surfaces are emphasized throughout, with polished materials for countertops and cabinets. The Open Central Area is designed to remain uncluttered, facilitating comfortable movement and interaction.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Preparation Area, a contemporary black granite worktop measuring 2.5 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.9 meters is recommended. The Storage Area features a modern stainless steel rack (1.0 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.8 meters) for pots and pans, and built-in cabinets (1.711 meters by 0.578 meters by 2.027 meters) for additional storage. The appliance area includes modern stainless steel elements to blend seamlessly with the kitchen design. A white kettle is suggested for the worktop, providing functional and aesthetic contrast. In the Open Central Area, a contemporary dining table (1.5 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.75 meters) with matching chairs (0.879 meters by 0.672 meters by 0.774 meters) is recommended to enhance the dining experience.

## 4. Scene Graph
The black granite worktop is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall, as it is a key element for food preparation. Its dimensions (2.5m x 0.6m x 0.9m) allow it to occupy a substantial portion of the wall, maximizing space efficiency and ensuring easy access. This placement aligns with the user's preference for a contemporary kitchen setup, creating a natural flow for kitchen activities and serving as a focal point.

The stainless steel rack is positioned on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.4m x 1.8m) ensure stability and accessibility for storing pots and pans. This placement avoids spatial conflicts with the worktop and enhances the kitchen's workflow, maintaining a sleek, contemporary look.

The white kettle is placed on the granite worktop against the north wall, facing the south wall. Its small size (0.245m x 0.334m x 0.333m) fits comfortably on the worktop, providing easy access for boiling water. The contrast between the white kettle and black worktop adds visual interest, adhering to the contemporary kitchen theme.

Built-in cabinets are placed against the west wall, facing the east wall. Their dimensions (1.711m x 0.578m x 2.027m) allow them to complement existing objects without causing spatial conflicts. The white color of the cabinets aligns with the contemporary style, providing necessary storage and maintaining a balanced room layout.

The appliance area is located on the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.6m x 1.0m) ensure it fits within the available space, maintaining balance and functionality. This placement allows easy access to appliances during food preparation, complementing the kitchen's aesthetic and functionality.

The dining table is centrally placed in the room, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.8m x 0.75m) allow it to serve as a functional and aesthetic centerpiece, ensuring it does not interfere with other kitchen elements. This placement facilitates convenient dining and movement, aligning with the contemporary style.

Dining chairs are positioned around the dining table. Dining chair 1 is placed in front of the table, facing the south wall, while dining chair 2 is placed behind the table, also facing the south wall. Their dimensions (0.879m x 0.672m x 0.774m) ensure they fit comfortably around the table, maintaining balance and usability in the dining area.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The layout ensures that all objects are accessible and visually appealing, adhering to the user's preferences for a contemporary kitchen design. The placement of each object maintains balance and functionality, ensuring efficient use of space without spatial conflicts.
