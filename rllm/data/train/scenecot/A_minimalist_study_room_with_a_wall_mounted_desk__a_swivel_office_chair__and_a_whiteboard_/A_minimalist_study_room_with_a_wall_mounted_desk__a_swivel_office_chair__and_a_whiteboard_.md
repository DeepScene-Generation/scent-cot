## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a minimalist study room with specific elements such as a wall-mounted desk, a swivel office chair, and a whiteboard. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for a minimalist design. The user prefers a layout that includes the south wall for the desk, the west wall for the whiteboard, and an open space in the middle of the room. The east wall features a window that allows natural light to enhance the minimalist aesthetic by creating a sense of openness and spaciousness. Additional items like a laptop, desk lamp, clock, small plant, and storage box are recommended to enhance functionality while maintaining the minimalist style, using materials like metal and wood in colors such as white and black.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to align with the user's minimalist design preferences. The Study Area is centered around the north wall, where the wall-mounted desk and swivel chair are placed for ergonomic seating and workspace. The Brainstorming Area is on the west wall, featuring the whiteboard for writing and sketching. The Lighting Area benefits from the east wall's window, providing natural light to the room. The Storage Area is under the desk, where a storage box is placed to minimize clutter. Each substructure serves a specific purpose, ensuring the room remains functional and aesthetically pleasing.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Study Area, a minimalist wall-mounted desk (1.5m x 0.5m x 0.75m) and a swivel office chair (0.663m x 0.683m x 0.986m) are recommended. The Brainstorming Area includes a minimalist whiteboard (1.2m x 0.05m x 1.0m) for writing and sketching. A modern laptop (0.35m x 0.25m x 0.03m) is suggested for computing tasks on the desk. A minimalist desk lamp (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) provides focused lighting, while a minimalist clock (0.3m x 0.05m x 0.3m) aids in time management. A small plant adds a touch of greenery, and a storage box (0.4m x 0.3m x 0.2m) is recommended for organizing items under the desk.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wall-mounted desk is placed on the north wall, centered for aesthetic balance and facing the south wall. This placement reduces distractions and aligns with the minimalist design, providing a functional workspace for studying and laptop use. The desk's dimensions (1.5m x 0.5m x 0.75m) fit comfortably against the wall without obstructing movement.

The swivel office chair is positioned in front of the desk, facing the north wall. This placement ensures easy access to the desk and maintains visual harmony. The chair's dimensions (0.663m x 0.683m x 0.986m) fit well in the available space, complementing the desk's minimalist style.

The whiteboard is mounted on the north wall above the desk, facing the south wall. This placement ensures it is within easy reach for someone seated at the desk. The whiteboard's dimensions (1.2m x 0.05m x 1.0m) fit comfortably above the desk space, maintaining visual balance.

The laptop is placed on the wall-mounted desk, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.35m x 0.25m x 0.03m) fit easily on the desk without conflicting with other objects, ensuring functionality and comfort for study purposes.

The desk lamp is placed on the desk, facing the south wall, adjacent to the laptop. Its dimensions (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) allow it to fit without obstructing the desk's functionality, providing necessary lighting while complementing the minimalist style.

The clock is mounted on the north wall above the desk, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.05m x 0.3m) ensure it does not cause spatial conflicts, maintaining a clean and uncluttered wall area.

The small plant, initially intended to be placed on the desk, was removed due to space constraints. The storage box is placed under the desk, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.3m x 0.2m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing legroom or chair movement.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose when attempting to place all objects on the wall-mounted desk, as its area was insufficient to accommodate the laptop, desk lamp, and small plant simultaneously. To resolve this, the small plant was removed, as it was deemed the least essential for the user's preference and the room's functionality. This decision maintained the minimalist aesthetic and ensured the desk remained functional and uncluttered.
