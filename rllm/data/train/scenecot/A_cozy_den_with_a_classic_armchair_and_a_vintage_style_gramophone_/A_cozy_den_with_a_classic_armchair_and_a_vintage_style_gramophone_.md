## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a cozy den that evokes a classic and nostalgic ambiance, featuring a classic armchair and a vintage-style gramophone. The room measures 5 meters by 5 meters with a ceiling height of 3 meters, providing ample space for additional objects. The user's preferences emphasize a classic aesthetic, with a focus on creating a warm and inviting atmosphere that supports relaxation and leisure.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key substructures to enhance both functionality and aesthetic appeal. These include a gramophone corner, an armchair nook, a display wall, and an open middle space. The gramophone corner is designed to house the gramophone and a vintage-style cabinet for record storage. The armchair nook is intended for relaxation, featuring a classic armchair and a small side table. The display wall is meant to showcase a collection of vintage-style frames, while the open middle space serves as a central gathering point, potentially featuring a coffee table and an area rug to tie the room together.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the gramophone corner, a vintage-style gramophone and a matching cabinet are recommended to complement the nostalgic theme. The armchair nook benefits from a classic armchair paired with a side table and a floor lamp for added comfort during reading or relaxation. The display wall can be enhanced with a vintage-style frame collection to hold personal photographs and artwork. An area rug is suggested to add warmth and texture, complementing the vintage and classic elements. A coffee table in the open middle space can serve as a central gathering point, allowing for interaction and leisure.

## 4. Scene Graph
The floor lamp, with dimensions of 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.7 meters, is placed on the west wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures the lamp provides adequate lighting for the armchair nook without obstructing sightlines, maintaining the cozy, classic atmosphere desired by the user. The lamp's position complements the armchair area, providing lighting for relaxation and reading.

The cabinet, measuring 1.0 meters by 0.435 meters by 1.2 meters, is positioned on the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement ensures accessibility for record storage and complements the gramophone, enhancing the room's vintage aesthetic. The cabinet's location maintains balance by distributing furniture evenly across the room, adding vertical interest without overwhelming the space.

The rug, with dimensions of 3.0 meters by 3.0 meters, is placed in the middle of the room. This central placement allows the rug to serve as a focal point, connecting the various elements in the room and adding warmth without obstructing the functionality or aesthetic of existing objects. The rug's classic style enhances the cozy ambiance of the den.

The frame collection, measuring 2.0 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.0 meters, is centered on the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement avoids spatial conflicts with existing objects and complements the room's vintage style. The frame collection adds both aesthetic and functional value to the room by displaying photos and acting as a decorative element.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to the limited space on the west wall and the need to maintain a cozy den atmosphere. The floor lamp and cabinet were initially positioned in ways that would place them out of bounds. To resolve these conflicts, the floor lamp was repositioned to the west wall, and the cabinet was also placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. Additionally, due to space constraints, the side table was removed to prioritize the armchair and gramophone, which are central to the user's vision for a cozy den with classic and vintage elements.
