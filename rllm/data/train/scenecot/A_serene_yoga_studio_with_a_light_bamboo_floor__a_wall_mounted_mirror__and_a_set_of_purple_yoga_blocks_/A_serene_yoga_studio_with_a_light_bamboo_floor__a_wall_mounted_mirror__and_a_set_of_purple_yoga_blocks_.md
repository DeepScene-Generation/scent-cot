## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a serene yoga studio characterized by a light bamboo floor, a wall-mounted mirror, and a set of purple yoga blocks. The room is intended to be tranquil, open, and aesthetically pleasing, focusing on safety and functionality. The dimensions of the room are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes a minimalist style, ensuring that the space remains uncluttered and conducive to yoga practice.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main components: the Yoga Practice Area, the Bamboo Flooring, and the Mirror Wall. The Yoga Practice Area is the central zone for yoga activities, requiring openness and minimal obstruction. The Bamboo Flooring is integral to the room's aesthetic and functional design, providing a natural and calming base. The Mirror Wall is essential for posture correction, enhancing the functionality of the studio.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Yoga Practice Area, a minimalist rubber yoga mat (1.8m x 0.6m x 0.02m) is recommended, along with a zen-style cotton meditation cushion (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m) and two modern foam yoga blocks (0.23m x 0.15m x 0.1m each) in purple to match the aesthetic. A minimalist wooden storage bench (1.2m x 0.4m x 0.5m) is suggested for storing yoga accessories. To complement the Bamboo Flooring, a contemporary metal floor lamp (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.5m) is recommended for ambient lighting. The Mirror Wall will feature a modern glass wall-mounted mirror (2.0m x 0.05m x 1.5m) for posture correction, with a modern wooden wall shelf (1.0m x 0.2m x 0.3m) for storing small items.

## 4. Scene Graph
The yoga mat is centrally placed in the room, oriented lengthwise parallel to the walls. This central placement ensures accessibility and maintains the serene, minimalist aesthetic desired by the user. The dimensions of the yoga mat are 1.8 meters in length, 0.6 meters in width, and 0.02 meters in height. The meditation cushion is placed adjacent to the yoga mat, facing the north wall, maintaining consistency with the yoga mat's orientation. This placement ensures a functional and aesthetically pleasing yoga practice area. The cushion's dimensions are 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters.

The first yoga block is placed to the right of the yoga mat, facing the north wall, ensuring it is accessible and functional. This placement keeps the space open and organized, enhancing the yoga studio's serene ambiance. The dimensions of the yoga block are 0.23 meters by 0.15 meters by 0.1 meters. The second yoga block is placed to the left of the yoga mat, mirroring the placement of the first block, creating balance and symmetry. This placement ensures balance, accessibility, and maintains the serene atmosphere of the yoga studio.

The storage bench is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This position maintains open space for yoga practice in the center of the room and ensures easy access to stored accessories. The bench's minimalist style complements the room's aesthetic, enhancing the serene atmosphere. The dimensions of the storage bench are 1.2 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.5 meters.

The floor lamp is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. This positioning provides ambient lighting throughout the room, complements the existing minimalist aesthetic, and ensures functionality by being outside the primary yoga practice area. The lamp's dimensions are 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.5 meters.

The wall shelf is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. It is mounted above the yoga mat area to provide easy access to small items. This placement complements the existing elements, maintains the room's serene and minimalist aesthetic, and fulfills the user's input preferences. The dimensions of the wall shelf are 1.0 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.3 meters.

The wall-mounted mirror is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. It is positioned below the wall shelf and directly in line with the yoga mat, ensuring clear visibility for posture checking during yoga sessions. The dimensions of the mirror are 2.0 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.5 meters.

## 5. Global Check
There are no conflicts detected in the current setup. The placement of each object has been carefully considered to ensure that the room remains open and functional, adhering to the user's vision of a serene yoga studio. The arrangement maintains balance and proportion, ensuring that all objects contribute to the room's intended purpose and aesthetic without causing spatial conflicts.

            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.5-4.5), y(4.9-4.9)
            - Final coordinates: x=1.1022, y=4.9, z=2.5136
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 1.1022, y: 4.9, z: 2.5136
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=1.1022, y=4.9, z=2.5136
        - conclusion: wall_shelf_1 placed successfully
