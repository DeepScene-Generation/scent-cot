## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user has expressed a desire to create a home gym within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary equipment requested includes a treadmill, an elliptical machine, and wall-mounted resistance bands. The user emphasizes the need for a functional and aesthetically pleasing gym space, with additional supportive objects such as a storage rack for gym accessories and a water bottle holder to enhance convenience and usability. The focus is on maintaining a clear and open exercise area, avoiding any interference with windows or ceiling elements.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key substructures to accommodate the user's requirements. The Treadmill Area is designated along the north wall, providing a dedicated space for cardio workouts. Adjacent to this is the Elliptical Machine Area, ensuring both machines are aligned for consistent use. The Resistance Bands Area is located on the south wall, allowing for strength training without occupying floor space. The central Open Exercise Space is reserved for flexibility exercises, featuring a yoga mat for stretching. Lastly, the Storage Area on the east wall is intended for organizing gym accessories, ensuring the room remains tidy and functional.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Treadmill Area, a modern black metal treadmill with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.0 meter by 1.5 meters is recommended. The Elliptical Machine Area features a modern silver metal elliptical machine, measuring 1.5 meters by 0.8 meters by 1.6 meters. Wall-mounted resistance bands, made of varied-colored rubber, are suggested for the Resistance Bands Area. In the Open Exercise Space, a minimalist blue rubber yoga mat, sized 1.8 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.02 meters, is recommended. The Storage Area includes a modern black metal storage rack, measuring 1.0 meter by 0.4 meter by 1.5 meters, to store gym accessories.

## 4. Scene Graph
The treadmill is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, as it is a central component of the home gym setup. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 1.5m) allow it to fit comfortably along the wall, providing ample space for safe usage and movement around it. This placement aligns with the user's preference for a functional gym and adheres to design principles by maintaining balance and proportion in the room.

Adjacent to the treadmill, the elliptical machine is positioned on the north wall, also facing the south wall. With dimensions of 1.5 meters by 0.8 meters by 1.6 meters, it complements the treadmill setup, ensuring both machines are aligned for consistent use. This placement allows for easy access and usage without obstruction, maintaining the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The resistance bands are mounted on the south wall, opposite the treadmill and elliptical. This placement ensures they do not occupy floor space and provide a clear view and access for the user. The varied-colored rubber bands, with dimensions of 0.951 meters by 0.793 meters by 0.379 meters, enhance the room's functionality by offering strength training options without interfering with existing equipment.

In the middle of the room, the yoga mat is placed to provide an open area for stretching and bodyweight exercises. Its dimensions (1.8m x 0.6m x 0.02m) ensure it does not obstruct the existing equipment, maintaining a clear and functional exercise space. The mat's blue color adds a visual contrast, enhancing the room's aesthetic.

The storage rack is positioned against the east wall, facing the west wall. With dimensions of 1.0 meter by 0.4 meter by 1.5 meters, it provides convenient access to gym accessories without taking up significant space. This placement maintains balance in the room layout, as other walls are utilized by larger equipment, ensuring the room remains organized and functional.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified regarding the placement of objects along the north wall, as the length was insufficient to accommodate the treadmill, elliptical machine, and water bottle holder. To resolve this, the water bottle holder was removed, as it was deemed the least critical to the user's preference for a home gym with essential cardio equipment and resistance bands. This adjustment ensures the room's functionality and aesthetic are maintained without compromising the user's primary requirements.
