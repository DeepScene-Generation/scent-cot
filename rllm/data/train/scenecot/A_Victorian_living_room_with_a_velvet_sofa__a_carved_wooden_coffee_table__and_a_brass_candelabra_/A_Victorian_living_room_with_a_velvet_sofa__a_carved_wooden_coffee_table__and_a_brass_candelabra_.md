## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a Victorian-style living room characterized by a velvet sofa, a carved wooden coffee table, and a brass candelabra. These elements are central to the room's aesthetic and functional design. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for additional Victorian-themed decor. The user desires a space that balances elegance and functionality, incorporating elements like a decorative rug, an armchair, a Victorian-style clock, a bookshelf, cushions, and a decorative vase to enhance the room's charm and utility.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to align with the user's Victorian theme. The Seating Area, anchored by the velvet sofa, serves as the primary zone for relaxation and social interaction. The Central Interaction Area, defined by the coffee table, facilitates conversation and serves as a focal point. The Lighting Area, highlighted by the brass candelabra, provides ambient lighting. Additional substructures include the Decorative Area, featuring the rug and vase, and the Storage and Display Area, represented by the bookshelf. Each substructure is designed to enhance the room's Victorian aesthetic while ensuring functionality.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a deep red velvet sofa and a deep green velvet armchair are recommended to provide luxurious seating. The Central Interaction Area features a carved wooden coffee table, complemented by a brass candelabra for ambient lighting. A floral-patterned wool rug defines the Decorative Area, adding warmth and cohesion. A Victorian-style clock on the north wall and a mahogany bookshelf on the east wall enhance the Storage and Display Area. Gold cushions on the sofa and a blue and white porcelain vase on the bookshelf add decorative touches, completing the Victorian theme.

## 4. Scene Graph
The velvet sofa, measuring 2.0m x 0.9m x 1.0m, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement optimizes space and adheres to Victorian design principles, providing a central focal point and allowing for easy seating and conversation. The carved wooden coffee table, 1.2m x 0.8m x 0.45m, is positioned centrally in front of the sofa, facilitating interaction and maintaining aesthetic balance. The brass candelabra, 0.4m x 0.4m x 0.6m, is placed on the coffee table, enhancing ambient lighting and the Victorian aesthetic. The floral-patterned wool rug, 3.0m x 2.0m, is placed under the coffee table, extending towards the sofa to define the seating area and add visual interest. The deep green velvet armchair, 1.0m x 0.8m x 1.0m, is placed to the right of the sofa, facing the north wall, providing additional seating and maintaining balance. The Victorian-style clock, 0.5m x 0.1m x 0.5m, is mounted on the north wall, serving as a decorative and functional element. The mahogany bookshelf, 1.0m x 0.4m x 2.0m, is placed against the east wall, offering storage and display space. The gold cushion, 0.5m x 0.5m x 0.15m, is placed on the sofa, enhancing comfort and decor. The blue and white porcelain vase, 0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m, is placed on the bookshelf, serving as a decorative focal point.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The objects were arranged to ensure spatial harmony and adherence to the Victorian theme, with careful consideration of balance, proportion, and functionality. The room's layout supports the user's aesthetic and functional requirements without necessitating any repositioning or removal of objects.

For vase_1
- parent object: bookshelf_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with bookshelf_1
        - calculation:
            - Rotation of vase_1: 0.0°
            - Rotation of bookshelf_1: 90.0°
            - Rotation difference: |0.0 - 90.0| = 90.0°
        - conclusion: Using width dimension for directional constraint
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'on' relation
        - calculation:
            - bookshelf_1 size: 1.0 (width)
            - Cluster size (on): max(0.0, 1.0) = 1.0
        - conclusion: vase_1 cluster size (on): 1.0
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'east_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - vase_1 size: length=0.3, width=0.3, height=0.6
            - x_min = 5.0 - 0.0/2 - 0.3/2 = 4.85
            - x_max = 5.0 - 0.0/2 - 0.3/2 = 4.85
            - y_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 0.3/2 = 0.15
            - y_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 0.3/2 = 4.85
            - z_min = 1.5 - 3.0/2 + 0.6/2 = 0.3
