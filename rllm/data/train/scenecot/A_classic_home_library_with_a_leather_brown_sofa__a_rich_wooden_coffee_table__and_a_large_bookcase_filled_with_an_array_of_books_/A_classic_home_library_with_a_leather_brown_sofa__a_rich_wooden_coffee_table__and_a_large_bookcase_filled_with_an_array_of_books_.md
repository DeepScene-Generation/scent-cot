## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a classic home library that combines elegance with functionality, featuring a leather brown sofa, a rich wooden coffee table, and a large bookcase filled with books. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, is intended to be a sanctuary for reading and relaxation. The design emphasizes a classic aesthetic, with a focus on creating a harmonious and inviting space without the inclusion of doors or windows.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main areas based on the user's requirements: the Bookcase Area, the Seating Area, and the Coffee Table Area. The Bookcase Area is positioned against the north wall, providing stability and a classic backdrop. The Seating Area, featuring a leather sofa, is located against the south wall, offering comfort and an inviting atmosphere. The Coffee Table Area is centrally located, serving as a functional and aesthetic focal point for the room.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Bookcase Area, a classic wooden bookcase with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 0.5 meters by 2.5 meters is recommended to store books and create a prominent backdrop. The Seating Area includes a leather brown sofa (2.0 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.8 meters) for comfort and style, complemented by a reading lamp and a side table for additional surface space. The Coffee Table Area features a rich wooden coffee table (1.2 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.5 meters) for placing books and beverages, along with decorative items to enhance sophistication. A rug is suggested to add warmth, and a floor lamp provides ambient lighting.

## 4. Scene Graph
The bookcase is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, to maximize vertical space and create a focal point. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.5m x 2.5m) fit well, allowing ample space for other furniture. This placement aligns with the user's vision of a classic library, ensuring balance and easy access to books.

The sofa is positioned against the south wall, facing the north wall, providing a comfortable seating area with a clear view of the bookcase. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.9m x 0.8m) fit comfortably, maintaining balance and proportion. The leather material complements the wooden bookcase, enhancing the classic aesthetic.

The coffee table is placed in front of the sofa, in the middle of the room, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.8m x 0.5m) allow it to serve as a functional surface for books and beverages, maintaining harmony and functionality within the classic library setting.

The reading lamp, with a brass finish, is placed to the right of the sofa, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.5m) ensure it provides adequate lighting without obstructing views, enhancing the seating area's functionality.

The rug is placed under the coffee table in the middle of the room, with dimensions (2.827m x 2.13m x 0.004m) that fit comfortably without interfering with other furniture. Its burgundy color complements the existing furniture, adding warmth and a classic aesthetic.

The side table is placed to the left of the sofa, facing the north wall, providing extra surface space. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.6m) ensure it fits well without causing spatial conflicts, enhancing functionality and maintaining balance.

Decorative items are placed on the coffee table, with dimensions suitable for adding visual interest without overcrowding. Their placement aligns with the user's preference for a classic aesthetic, enhancing the room's visual appeal.

The floor lamp is placed left of the bookcase on the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.7m) ensure it provides balanced ambient lighting, enhancing the room's classic and cozy atmosphere.

The armchair is placed in front of the sofa, facing the south wall, providing additional seating. Its dimensions (0.9m x 0.8m x 0.9m) ensure it complements the seating arrangement without obstructing access to the coffee table.

The ottoman is placed in front of the armchair, facing the south wall, serving as a footrest. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.5m) allow it to enhance comfort and usability without obstructing movement.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the initial placement of the armchair behind the sofa, as it would be out of bounds. To resolve this, the armchair was repositioned in front of the sofa, maintaining the classic aesthetic and providing additional seating without spatial conflicts. Another conflict involved the ottoman's placement in front of the armchair, which was resolved by ensuring it did not interfere with the coffee table, maintaining functionality and aesthetic harmony.
