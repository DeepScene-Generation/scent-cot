## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a traditional study room characterized by a warm and inviting atmosphere conducive to study and reflection. The room's dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a wooden desk, a green banker's lamp, and a leather-bound book, all contributing to the traditional and timeless style. The user emphasizes the need for a desk area, a bookshelf area for storing books, and a seating area for comfort during extended periods. Additional elements like a rug, a traditional clock, and artwork are suggested to enhance the traditional aesthetic and create a cohesive environment.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main substructures: the Desk Area, the Bookshelf Area, and the Seating Area. The Desk Area is central to the room's function, requiring a wooden desk and a banker's lamp for reading and writing. The Bookshelf Area is designated for storing and organizing leather-bound books, maintaining the traditional aesthetic. The Seating Area is designed for comfort, with a chair that complements the desk and contributes to the room's visual harmony. Additional elements such as a rug, clock, and artwork are considered to enhance the room's traditional style.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Desk Area, a traditional wooden desk measuring 1.5 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended, along with a green banker's lamp (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.4 meters) for focused lighting. A leather-bound book (0.25 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.03 meters) is included to enhance the ambiance. The Bookshelf Area features a traditional wooden bookshelf (1.2 meters by 0.3 meters by 2.0 meters) for storing books. The Seating Area includes a traditional chair (0.7 meters by 0.7 meters by 1.0 meters) made of wood and leather. Additional elements include a wool rug (2.0 meters by 1.5 meters), a traditional clock (0.4 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.5 meters), and a canvas artwork (1.0 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.7 meters) to complete the traditional aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden desk is placed centrally against the north wall, facing the south wall, to set the tone for the traditional study. This placement allows for a balanced layout and offers a visually appealing and functional setup. The desk's dimensions (1.5m x 0.8m x 0.75m) fit well within the room, leaving ample space for movement and additional elements. The banker's lamp is placed on the desk to provide focused lighting for reading and writing, maintaining adjacency to the desk for functional lighting. The lamp's small size ensures no spatial conflicts, and its traditional style complements the desk aesthetically.

The leather-bound book is also placed on the desk, adjacent to the lamp, providing easy access for reading and aligning with the study's functionality. The book's small dimensions allow it to fit comfortably on the desk without interfering with the lamp. The bookshelf is positioned on the west wall, facing the east wall, to maintain visual balance and provide easy access from the desk. Its traditional wood finish complements the room's decor, contributing to a cohesive and functional study environment.

The chair is placed in front of the desk, facing it, to optimize space and adhere to the room's functionality. This placement ensures no spatial conflicts and aligns with the traditional study setup, allowing for comfortable seating while working at the desk. The rug is placed under the desk and chair, oriented to face the north wall, creating a cohesive and inviting workspace. Its red and gold colors enhance the traditional aesthetic and provide comfort.

The traditional clock is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, ensuring visibility from the desk and aligning with the room's traditional style. The clock's gold color adds elegance, enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal. Finally, the artwork is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall, serving as a focal point in the room and contributing to the traditional aesthetic without conflicting with other objects.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the initial placement of the chair behind the desk, which would have placed it out of bounds. To resolve this, the chair was repositioned in front of the desk, facing it, ensuring it remains within the room's boundaries and maintains functionality. This adjustment preserves the traditional aesthetic and ensures a functional study area without spatial conflicts.
