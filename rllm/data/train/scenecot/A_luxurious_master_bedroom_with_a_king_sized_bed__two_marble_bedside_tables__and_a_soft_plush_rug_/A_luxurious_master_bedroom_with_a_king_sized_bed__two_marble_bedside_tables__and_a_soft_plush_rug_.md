## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a luxurious master bedroom with a king-sized bed, two marble bedside tables, and a plush rug. The room's dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for a luxurious setup. The user emphasizes a cohesive design theme centered around luxury, with additional functional elements such as lamps, a wardrobe, and a seating area with an accent chair and a small table to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetics.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key areas based on the user's requirements. The central area is designated for the king-sized bed, serving as the focal point of the room. The bedside area includes two marble tables, providing symmetry and functionality. The floor area features a plush rug, enhancing comfort and decor. Additional substructures include a wardrobe area for storage and a seating area with an accent chair and a small table for relaxation and reading.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central area, a luxurious king-sized bed with dimensions of 2.1 meters by 2.1 meters is recommended. The bedside area features two marble bedside tables, each measuring 0.461 meters by 0.424 meters by 0.495 meters, complementing the bed's design. The plush rug, measuring 3.0 meters by 2.5 meters, is suggested for the floor area to provide comfort and enhance the room's decor. Additional recommendations include modern lamps with a metallic and glass finish for the bedside tables, a classic wardrobe (1.5 meters by 0.6 meters by 2.0 meters) for storage, and a modern accent chair (0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.9 meters) with a small table (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters) for the seating area.

## 4. Scene Graph
The king-sized bed is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to establish the room's layout and style. This placement ensures the bed is the central piece, adhering to the user's preference for a luxurious bedroom. The bed's dimensions (2.1m x 2.1m x 1.2m) allow it to be a significant focal point without hindering movement, providing space for additional furniture like bedside tables.

The first marble bedside table is positioned to the left of the bed, adjacent to it, facing the north wall. This placement ensures functional proximity and maintains a cohesive design, complementing the bed's luxurious style. The table's dimensions (0.461m x 0.424m x 0.495m) fit comfortably in the space, providing symmetry and easy access for occupants.

The second marble bedside table is placed to the right of the bed, mirroring the first table to ensure symmetry and functionality. This placement aligns with the user's preference for having two bedside tables, one on each side of the bed. The table's dimensions match the first, ensuring a consistent aesthetic.

The plush rug is centered in the middle of the floor, with its longer side parallel to the bed, starting from under the foot of the bed and extending into the center of the room. This placement enhances comfort and decor, aligning with the luxurious theme. The rug's dimensions (3.0m x 2.5m x 0.05m) ensure it does not obstruct movement and complements the existing layout.

Lamp_1 is placed on the first marble bedside table, to the left of the bed, facing the north wall. This placement ensures balance and symmetry, enhancing both the aesthetic and functional aspects of the room. The lamp's dimensions (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) fit well on the table, providing localized lighting.

Lamp_2 is placed on the second marble bedside table, facing the north wall, ensuring symmetrical aesthetics and functionality, similar to lamp_1. This placement provides balanced lighting and complements the luxurious theme.

The wardrobe is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement ensures it is accessible and does not interfere with the existing layout. The wardrobe's dimensions (1.5m x 0.6m x 2.0m) fit well within the room, providing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The accent chair is placed in the middle of the room on the plush rug, facing the south wall. This placement provides a functional seating option without disrupting the flow of the room, adding to the luxurious ambiance desired by the user. The chair's dimensions (0.8m x 0.8m x 0.9m) ensure it does not clutter the space.

The small table is placed on the plush rug, next to the accent chair, in the middle of the room. It faces the south wall, complementing the seating arrangement without obstructing movement or access to other furniture. The table's dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.5m) allow it to function effectively as a convenient surface for holding items near the chair.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed in a manner that respects the room's dimensions and the user's preferences for a luxurious and functional master bedroom. The layout ensures balance, symmetry, and accessibility, adhering to design principles and enhancing the room's overall aesthetic.
