## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a luxurious dressing room that combines elegance with functionality. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a full-length mirror, a vanity table, and a plush ottoman, with the mirror and vanity table positioned against the north and south walls, respectively, and the ottoman centrally located. The user desires a luxurious ambiance, with minimal decoration on the east and west walls, and additional elements like a decorative rug, accent chair, chandelier, wall art, and storage cabinet to enhance both the room's aesthetic and practical functionality.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures: the Mirror Area on the north wall for dressing and styling, the Vanity Area on the south wall for grooming, and the Seating Area in the middle of the room for relaxation. The east and west walls serve as decorative zones, with minimal furnishings to maintain openness. The ceiling is designated for lighting, enhancing the room's luxurious feel.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Mirror Area, a modern full-length mirror with integrated LED lighting is recommended. The Vanity Area features a modern vanity table with storage and a matching gold vanity chair. The Seating Area includes a plush navy blue ottoman and a cream decorative rug. An accent chair in black leather is suggested for additional seating against the east wall. A chandelier with clear crystal elements is recommended for central lighting, while wall art adds visual interest to the east wall. A modern white storage cabinet is proposed for the west wall to store beauty products and accessories.

        5. reason: Collision check with other objects
            - calculation:
                - No collision detected with accent_chair_1
            - conclusion: No collision detected.
        6. reason: Final position calculation
            - calculation:
                - Selected position within overlap: x=4.975, y=3.093890235621544, z=1.636459435635462

For storage_cabinet_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with no child
        - calculation:
            - storage_cabinet_1 has no child, so no rotation difference calculation needed.
        - conclusion: No rotation difference calculation required.
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'west_wall' relation
        - calculation:
            - storage_cabinet_1 size: length=1.0, width=0.5, height=1.2
            - Cluster size: {'left of': 0.0, 'right of': 0.0, 'behind': 0.0, 'in front': 0.0}
        - conclusion: No directional constraint applied.
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'west_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - Room size: 5.0x5.0x3.0
            - x_min = 0 + 0.0/2 + 0.5/2 = 0.25
            - x_max = 0 + 0.0/2 + 0.5/2 = 0.25
            - y_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 1.0/2 = 0.5
            - y_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 1.0/2 = 4.5
            - z_min = z_max = 1.2/2 = 0.6
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 4.5, 0.6, 0.6)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.25-0.25), y(0.5-4.5)
            - Final coordinates: x=0.25, y=2.1708926710140486, z=0.6
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.25, y: 2.1708926710140486, z: 0.6
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected.
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=0.25, y=2.1708926710140486, z=0.6
        - conclusion: Object placed successfully.
