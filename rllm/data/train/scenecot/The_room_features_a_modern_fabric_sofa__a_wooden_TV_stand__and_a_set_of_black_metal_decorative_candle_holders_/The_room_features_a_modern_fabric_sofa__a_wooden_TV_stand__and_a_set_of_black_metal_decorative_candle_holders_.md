## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern living room characterized by a fabric sofa, a wooden TV stand, and black metal decorative candle holders. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a 3.0-meter ceiling height, is designed to facilitate movement and social interaction through an open layout. The primary seating area is centered around the modern fabric sofa, which should face the TV for optimal viewing. The TV stand is essential for supporting the television and should be at a comfortable height for viewing from the sofa. Decorative elements like candle holders are intended to enhance the room's ambiance. Additional objects such as a coffee table and a rug are suggested to define the seating area, while modern armchairs can provide extra seating. The overall aesthetic should remain modern and minimalist, with sleek designs and a neutral color palette.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Seating Area is the primary zone, centered around the sofa and designed for comfort and social interaction. The Entertainment Area is defined by the TV stand, which supports the television and serves as a focal point for viewing. The Decorative Area includes the placement of candle holders to enhance visual interest and ambiance. The Coffee Table Area is intended for functionality, providing a surface for items like remote controls and magazines. The Rug Area defines the seating space, adding comfort and visual cohesion. Lastly, the Additional Seating Area accommodates armchairs to enhance the room's functionality and seating capacity.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a modern fabric sofa in gray, measuring 2.0 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.8 meters, is recommended for comfort and style. The Entertainment Area features a wooden TV stand, 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.6 meters, to support the television. In the Decorative Area, black metal candle holders, each 0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters, are suggested to add warmth and visual interest. The Coffee Table Area includes a modern glass coffee table, 1.0 meters by 0.5 meters, to complement the seating arrangement. A rug, 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters, is recommended for the Rug Area to define the seating space. Finally, modern fabric armchairs, each 0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.9 meters, are proposed for the Additional Seating Area to provide extra seating.

## 4. Scene Graph
The modern fabric sofa is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to create a balanced and functional layout. This placement allows the sofa to serve as the main seating area, providing a clear view across the room and aligning with the user's preference for a modern style. The sofa's dimensions (2.0m x 0.9m x 0.8m) ensure it fits comfortably against the wall, maintaining an open layout.

The wooden TV stand is positioned against the north wall, facing the south wall, directly across from the sofa. This placement supports the television and ensures optimal viewing from the sofa. The TV stand's dimensions (1.5m x 0.5m x 0.6m) allow it to fit well on the 5.0-meter wall, maintaining balance and symmetry in the room layout.

The black metal decorative candle holders are placed on the TV stand, facing the south wall. This placement enhances the room's ambiance and maintains a modern aesthetic. The candle holders' small size (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) ensures they do not interfere with the TV stand's primary function.

The coffee table, with its modern glass design, is placed in front of the sofa, facing the north wall. This central placement between the sofa and TV stand allows for optimal use and access, enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal. The coffee table's dimensions (1.0m x 0.5m) ensure it does not obstruct movement.

The rug is placed under the coffee table and in front of the sofa, defining the seating area. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m) fit well within the space, adding comfort and visual interest without overlapping other objects.

The first armchair is placed to the right of the sofa, facing the north wall. This placement maintains the seating arrangement's cohesiveness and provides additional seating without disrupting the room's flow. The armchair's dimensions (0.8m x 0.8m x 0.9m) ensure it fits comfortably in the space.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified regarding the south wall's capacity to accommodate all intended objects, including the rug, coffee table, sofa, and armchairs. To resolve this, the rug was removed based on its lower functional priority compared to the seating and entertainment areas. This decision maintains the room's modern aesthetic and functionality while ensuring the layout remains open and uncluttered.
