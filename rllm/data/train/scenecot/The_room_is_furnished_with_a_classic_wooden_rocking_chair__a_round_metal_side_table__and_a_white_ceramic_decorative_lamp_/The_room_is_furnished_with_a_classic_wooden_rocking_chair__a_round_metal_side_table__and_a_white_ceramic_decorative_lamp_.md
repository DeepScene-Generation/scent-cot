## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a cozy room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The room should feature a classic wooden rocking chair, a round metal side table, and a white ceramic decorative lamp. The user emphasizes a warm and inviting atmosphere with ergonomic seating, functional surfaces, and ambient lighting. The style preference leans towards classic elements, with a focus on creating a cohesive and functional space that does not exceed 15 items.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key substructures to accommodate the user's requirements. These include designated areas for the rocking chair, side table, and lamp, ensuring each piece serves its intended purpose. The room layout incorporates the south, north, west, and east walls, as well as the middle of the room and the ceiling, to optimize the placement of furniture and decorative items.

## 3. Object Recommendations
To fulfill the user's needs, the recommended objects include a classic wooden rocking chair, a modern round metal side table, and a white ceramic decorative lamp. Additional recommendations include a classic beige fabric sofa, a classic wooden coffee table, a dark brown wooden bookshelf, a bohemian-style rug, abstract canvas artwork, and a modern plant in a ceramic pot. These objects are chosen for their style, dimensions, and functionality, enhancing the room's classic and warm aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The classic wooden rocking chair, measuring 0.8 meters by 1.0 meter by 1.0 meter, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures it is easily accessible and its rocking motion is unobstructed, aligning with the user's preference for classic wooden furniture. The side table, with dimensions of 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.6 meters, is positioned to the right of the rocking chair, also facing the north wall. This ensures convenience for someone seated in the chair, maintaining balance and functionality.

The decorative lamp, measuring 0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters, is placed on the side table, enhancing functionality by providing illumination for the rocking chair. The classic beige fabric sofa, measuring 1.8 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.8 meters, is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement maintains spatial harmony and complements the existing furniture arrangement.

The classic wooden coffee table, measuring 1.0 meter by 0.6 meters by 0.45 meters, is centrally placed in front of the sofa, creating a functional and visually appealing setup. The dark brown wooden bookshelf, measuring 0.9 meters by 0.3 meters by 2.0 meters, is placed against the north wall, providing storage and balancing the room's visual weight.

The bohemian-style rug, measuring 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters by 0.01 meters, is centered under the coffee table, tying together the seating arrangement and enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal. The abstract canvas artwork, measuring 1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 1.5 meters, is mounted on the south wall above the rocking chair, side table, and lamp, adding a decorative touch without causing spatial conflicts.

Finally, the modern plant in a ceramic pot, measuring 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.0 meter, is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement adds a touch of greenery and balances the room aesthetically without obstructing movement.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The arrangement of objects maintains spatial harmony and adheres to the user's preferences and design principles. Each object is positioned to enhance functionality and aesthetic appeal, ensuring a cohesive and inviting room environment.
