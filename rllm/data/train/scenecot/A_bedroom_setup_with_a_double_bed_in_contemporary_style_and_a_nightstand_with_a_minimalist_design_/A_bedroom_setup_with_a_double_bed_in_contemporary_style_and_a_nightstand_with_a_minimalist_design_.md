## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a minimalist bedroom with a contemporary double bed and a minimalist nightstand, emphasizing a serene and uncluttered atmosphere. The room should feature neutral tones and maintain open space for movement. The central sleeping area is the focal point, requiring a contemporary double bed that emphasizes comfort and tranquility. The nightstand should complement the bed with a minimalist design, providing space for a lamp and a few essentials. The room's dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, allowing for a spacious layout that supports the minimalist aesthetic.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key substructures based on user requirements. The Sleeping Area is the primary focus, featuring the contemporary double bed as the centerpiece against the south wall. The Nightstand Area is adjacent to the bed, providing functionality and complementing the minimalist design. The Open Movement Space is crucial for maintaining the minimalist design, ensuring the room remains clear of unnecessary furniture. Additional elements include a Lighting Area with a lamp on the nightstand, a Decorative Area with a rug in the center of the room, and a Storage Area with a wall-mounted bookshelf on the north wall.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sleeping Area, a contemporary double bed measuring 2.0 meters by 1.8 meters by 0.5 meters is recommended. The Nightstand Area features a minimalist wooden nightstand with dimensions of 0.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.5 meters, providing space for essentials. A minimalist metal lamp, measuring 0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters, is recommended for the Lighting Area. The Decorative Area includes a contemporary fabric rug with dimensions of 1.5 meters by 1.0 meters, adding texture and visual interest. The Storage Area features a minimalist wooden bookshelf measuring 0.8 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.5 meters, and a modern decorative plant in a ceramic pot, measuring 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.7 meters, enhances the room's aesthetics.

## 4. Scene Graph
The bed is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, as it is the primary object in the bedroom setup. This placement maximizes space utilization and ensures stability, aligning with the user's preference for a contemporary style. The bed's dimensions (2.0m x 1.8m x 0.5m) fit comfortably against the wall, providing a balanced look with the potential addition of a nightstand. The nightstand is placed to the left of the bed, adjacent to it, and facing the north wall. This placement ensures easy access to essentials while maintaining a clutter-free and balanced arrangement. The nightstand's dimensions (0.5m x 0.4m x 0.5m) complement the bed, creating a cohesive aesthetic.

The lamp is placed on the nightstand, ensuring it is functional and accessible. Its minimalist design aligns with the user's input for a minimalist nightstand, and its placement ensures balance and proportion within the room. The lamp's dimensions (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) allow it to fit comfortably on the nightstand without conflicting with other objects. The rug is placed in the middle of the room, maintaining a neutral color scheme that complements the contemporary style. Its dimensions (1.5m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably without encroaching on the bed or nightstand, enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal and functionality.

The bookshelf is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall, with no adjacency to any other objects. This placement provides visual balance with the bed arrangement on the south wall and ensures it serves its function as a storage unit without obstructing movement. The bookshelf's dimensions (0.8m x 0.3m x 1.5m) complement the existing furniture and enhance the room's overall design. The plant is placed on the floor to the left of the bookshelf on the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement complements the minimalist style and does not interfere with the room's functionality or movement space. The plant's dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.7m) ensure it fits comfortably in the designated area, adding to the contemporary and minimalist aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
There are no conflicts identified in the room layout, as all objects are placed strategically to maintain balance and functionality. The placement of each object respects the user's preferences for a minimalist design, ensuring a clean and uncluttered atmosphere. The design principles of balance and proportion are adhered to, with objects distributed around the room to enhance visual interest and functionality.
