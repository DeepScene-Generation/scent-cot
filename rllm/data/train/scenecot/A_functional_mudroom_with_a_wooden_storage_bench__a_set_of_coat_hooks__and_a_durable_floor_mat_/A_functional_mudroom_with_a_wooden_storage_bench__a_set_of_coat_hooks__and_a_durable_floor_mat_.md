## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a functional mudroom designed to accommodate daily activities, with specific elements such as a wooden storage bench, coat hooks, and a durable floor mat. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The entrance is located on the south wall, while the north wall is designated for the bench and hooks. The central floor area is reserved for the mat. The user emphasizes the need for practicality and cleanliness, suggesting additional items like an umbrella stand and a mirror to enhance utility without overcrowding the space. The overall aesthetic leans towards a rustic style, with a focus on functionality and ease of use.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The mudroom is divided into several functional substructures based on user requirements. The Seating and Storage Area is located along the north wall, featuring the wooden storage bench. Above this, the Hanging Area is designated for coat hooks, providing easy access for hanging outerwear. The Entryway Area includes the floor mat, strategically placed to trap dirt and moisture. Additional substructures include the Accessory Area, featuring a key holder and umbrella stand for convenience, and the Visual Check Area, where a mirror is positioned for last-minute appearance checks.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating and Storage Area, a rustic wooden storage bench measuring 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters is recommended, offering both seating and storage. The Hanging Area includes industrial-style metal coat hooks, 1.0 meter in length, mounted above the bench. The Entryway Area features a minimalist rubber floor mat, 1.2 meters by 0.8 meters, placed centrally to trap dirt. The Accessory Area includes a modern metal umbrella stand (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.6 meters) and a wooden key holder (0.3 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.1 meters). The Visual Check Area is enhanced with a contemporary glass mirror, measuring 0.694 meters by 0.089 meters by 1.544 meters. A rustic wicker basket (0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.3 meters) is also recommended for storing accessories.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden storage bench is a central element, placed against the north wall facing the south wall. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.5m x 0.5m) allow it to serve as both seating and storage, aligning with the user's functional requirements. This placement ensures the bench is easily accessible upon entering the room, providing structural support and maintaining balance within the space.

Above the bench, the coat hooks are mounted on the north wall, facing the south wall. Their placement directly above the bench ensures easy access for hanging coats while seated. The hooks' dimensions (1.0m x 0.1m x 0.2m) fit comfortably above the bench, maintaining a cohesive aesthetic and functional layout.

The floor mat is placed on the floor in front of the storage bench, facing the north wall. Its size (1.2m x 0.8m x 0.02m) fits comfortably in this area, ensuring it effectively traps dirt without obstructing movement. This strategic placement aligns with the user's preference for a functional mudroom.

The umbrella stand is positioned on the north wall, left of the storage bench. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) allow it to fit snugly without obstructing access to the bench or other elements. This placement enhances the mudroom's functionality by providing a convenient location for storing umbrellas.

The mirror is mounted on the north wall, to the right of the coat hooks, facing the south wall. Its vertical design (0.694m x 0.089m x 1.544m) ensures it does not obstruct other objects while remaining visible for user convenience. This placement allows for easy visual checks, enhancing the room's functionality.

The shoe rack is placed directly to the right of the storage bench on the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.3m x 0.3m) allow it to fit without blocking the walkway or access to other elements. This placement optimizes functionality, providing easy access and storage for shoes.

The key holder is mounted on the north wall, left of the coat hooks, and above the storage bench. Its small size (0.3m x 0.1m x 0.1m) ensures it does not occupy much wall space, maintaining functionality and accessibility without overcrowding the space.

The basket is placed on the wooden storage bench, to the right of the bench's center. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.3m) allow it to sit comfortably without obstructing the use of the bench or other elements. This placement enhances the room's organization, providing a designated space for accessories.

## 5. Global Check
There are no conflicts detected in the current layout. All objects are placed strategically to avoid spatial conflicts, ensuring the room remains functional and aesthetically pleasing. The arrangement adheres to user preferences and design principles, maintaining balance and proportion throughout the space.

For key_holder_1
- parent object: coat_hooks_1
    - calculation_steps:
        1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with coat_hooks_1
            - calculation:
                - Rotation of key_holder_1: 180.0°
                - Rotation of coat_hooks_1: 180.0°
