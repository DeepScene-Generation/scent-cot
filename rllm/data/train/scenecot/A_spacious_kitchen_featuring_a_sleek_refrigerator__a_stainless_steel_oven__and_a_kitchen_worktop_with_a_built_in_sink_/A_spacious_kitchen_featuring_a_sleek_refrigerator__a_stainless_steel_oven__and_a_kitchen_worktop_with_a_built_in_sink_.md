## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern and efficient kitchen that accommodates both social interaction and solo cooking. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a sleek refrigerator, a stainless steel oven, and a kitchen worktop with a built-in sink. The user desires an open and cohesive aesthetic, emphasizing functionality and style without cluttering the space. The kitchen should facilitate an efficient workflow while maintaining a spacious feel, allowing for both cooking and social activities.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The kitchen is divided into several functional substructures. The Storage Area is designated for the refrigerator, serving as the focal point for food storage. The Cooking Area includes the oven and worktop, essential for meal preparation and baking. The Central Social Area is intended for a kitchen island, providing additional prep space and seating. The Decorative Area is meant for enhancing the kitchen's aesthetic with elements like a potted plant and hanging light fixture.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Storage Area, a modern metal refrigerator with dimensions of 1.138 meters by 0.986 meters by 2.335 meters is recommended. The Cooking Area features a stainless steel oven and a kitchen worktop with a built-in sink, both crucial for functionality. The Central Social Area includes a minimalist kitchen island (1.5 meters by 0.8 meters) and modern bar stools for seating. The Decorative Area is enhanced with a hanging light fixture and a small potted plant, adding greenery and visual appeal.

## 4. Scene Graph
The refrigerator is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, as it is a key element for food storage. Its dimensions (1.138m x 0.986m x 2.335m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, ensuring it does not obstruct pathways or future kitchen installations. This placement aligns with user preferences for a spacious kitchen and adheres to design principles of balance and functionality.

The potted plant is placed on the floor against the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement ensures it is visible and adds a touch of nature to the kitchen without obstructing movement or functionality. The plant's dimensions (0.229m x 0.177m x 0.224m) ensure it does not interfere with the kitchen's workflow, maintaining the room's open feel and adhering to the user's preference for a modern aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited space on the west wall, which could not accommodate the refrigerator, oven, and worktop simultaneously. Additionally, the width of the oven was insufficient to accommodate the worktop next to it. To resolve these conflicts, the oven and worktop were removed, as the refrigerator was prioritized for its essential role in food storage. This decision aligns with the user's preference for a spacious kitchen featuring a sleek refrigerator. The removal of these objects ensures the room remains functional and uncluttered, adhering to the user's aesthetic and functional requirements.

For refrigerator_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with west_wall
        - calculation:
            - Rotation of refrigerator_1: 90° or 270°
            - Rotation of west_wall: 90° or 270°
            - Rotation difference: |90 - 90| = 0°
        - conclusion: Using width dimension for directional constraint
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'left of' relation
        - calculation:
            - refrigerator_1 size: 1.138 (length), 0.986 (width)
            - Cluster size (left of): 0.0
        - conclusion: No directional constraint applied
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'west_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - Room size: 5.0x5.0x3.0
            - x_min = 0 + 0.986 / 2 = 0.493
