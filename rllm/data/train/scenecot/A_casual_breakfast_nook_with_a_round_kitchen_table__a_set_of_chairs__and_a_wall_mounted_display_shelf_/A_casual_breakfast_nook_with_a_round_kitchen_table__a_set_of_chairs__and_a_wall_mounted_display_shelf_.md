## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a breakfast nook designed for casual dining and social interactions, featuring a round kitchen table, a set of chairs, and a wall-mounted display shelf. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, is intended to be both functional and aesthetically pleasing, with space for displaying decorative items. The user prefers a modern style and desires a layout that allows for easy movement and ergonomic comfort, avoiding window-related items and focusing on essential furniture and decor.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The central area is designated for the dining setup, featuring the round kitchen table and chairs, which are essential for meals and socializing. The north wall is reserved for the wall-mounted display shelf, intended for showcasing decorative items and enhancing the room's aesthetic. Additional substructures include a defined dining area with a rug under the table and a storage area with a sideboard on the south wall for additional storage needs.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central dining area, a modern round kitchen table with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 1.2 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended, accompanied by four modern wooden chairs, each measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.9 meters. A modern metal display shelf, 1.5 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.6 meters, is suggested for the north wall to display decorative items. A gray fabric rug, 2.0 meters by 2.0 meters, is recommended to define the dining area, while a modern sideboard, 1.2 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.8 meters, is proposed for the south wall to provide additional storage.

## 4. Scene Graph
The round kitchen table is placed centrally in the room, as it is the focal point of the breakfast nook. Its dimensions (1.2m x 1.2m x 0.75m) allow it to fit comfortably in the middle, providing ample space for movement and social interaction. This central placement aligns with the user's vision of an accessible and open dining area, ensuring balance and proportion in the room's layout.

Chair_1 is positioned to the south of the table, facing the north wall. Its placement ensures easy access and functionality, complementing the table's central position. The chair's dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.9m) allow it to fit comfortably without overcrowding, maintaining the room's open and inviting atmosphere.

Chair_2 is placed opposite chair_1, behind the table, also facing the north wall. This symmetrical arrangement enhances balance and accessibility, ensuring a cohesive and functional seating setup. The chair's size (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.9m) fits well within the available space, supporting the casual breakfast nook theme.

Chair_3 is positioned to the left of the table, facing the east wall. This placement ensures an even distribution of seating around the table, enhancing both functionality and aesthetics. The chair's dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.9m) allow it to fit comfortably, maintaining the room's balance and proportion.

Chair_4 is placed to the right of the table, facing the west wall. This completes the balanced seating arrangement around the table, promoting social interaction and maintaining the room's casual atmosphere. The chair's size (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.9m) ensures it fits well without disrupting the room's flow.

The display shelf is wall-mounted on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its placement avoids floor space clutter and complements the central table setup, providing a modern touch to the room. The shelf's dimensions (1.5m x 0.3m x 0.6m) allow it to fit comfortably on the wall, enhancing the room's aesthetic without interfering with the dining area.

The rug is placed directly under the table and chairs, defining the dining area and enhancing the room's aesthetic. Its dimensions (2.0m x 2.0m) ensure it fits well within the central space, complementing the modern style and gray color scheme.

The sideboard is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its placement provides additional storage while maintaining the room's balance and proportion. The sideboard's dimensions (1.2m x 0.4m x 0.8m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, complementing the modern aesthetic and providing functionality without disrupting the room's flow.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The layout accommodates all objects without spatial conflicts, ensuring a harmonious and functional breakfast nook. The arrangement adheres to the user's preferences and design principles, maintaining balance, proportion, and accessibility throughout the room.
