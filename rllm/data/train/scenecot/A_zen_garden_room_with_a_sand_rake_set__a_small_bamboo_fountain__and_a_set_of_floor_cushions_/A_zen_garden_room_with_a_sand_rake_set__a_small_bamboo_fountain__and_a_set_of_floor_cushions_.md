## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a zen garden room that emphasizes tranquility, meditation, and relaxation. Essential elements include a sand rake set, a bamboo fountain, and floor cushions, all contributing to a minimalist aesthetic that integrates natural elements. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space to create a serene environment. The user desires a space that is both functional and visually calming, with additional suggestions for a small plant or bonsai, a low table for tea or accessories, and an incense holder to enhance the sensory experience.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key areas to fulfill the user's requirements. The central area is designated for the sand rake set, which serves as the focal point for stress relief and meditation. The south wall is reserved for the bamboo fountain, providing auditory and visual tranquility. Floor cushions are strategically placed around the sand rake set to offer comfortable seating for meditation. Additional areas include space for a bonsai or small plant to enhance natural aesthetics, and a low table for tea or accessories, maintaining the room's minimalist and harmonious design.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central area, a minimalist sand rake set measuring 1.5 meters by 1.5 meters is recommended to facilitate sand manipulation. The bamboo fountain, positioned against the west wall, is crafted from natural bamboo and measures 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.8 meters, enhancing the room's tranquility. Floor cushions, made of cotton in earthy tones, are suggested for seating around the sand rake set, each measuring 0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.15 meters. A bonsai tree in a ceramic pot, measuring 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.4 meters, is recommended to complement the zen theme. A minimalist wooden shelf, measuring 1.0 meter by 0.2 meters by 0.2 meters, provides storage without disrupting the room's flow.

## 4. Scene Graph
The sand rake set is placed centrally on the floor, facing the north wall, to serve as the focal point of the zen garden. Its dimensions (1.5m x 1.5m x 0.1m) allow it to be accessible from all sides, respecting the minimalist style and providing balance and symmetry. The bamboo fountain, a key element for auditory and visual tranquility, is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. Its placement ensures it does not obstruct movement or interfere with other elements, maintaining a serene backdrop. The floor cushions are strategically placed around the sand rake set: one to the right, one to the left, and one in front, forming a triangular seating arrangement. Each cushion faces the north wall, except the one in front, which faces the south wall, ensuring accessibility and maintaining a clear path to the bamboo fountain. The bonsai tree is placed on the west wall, right of the bamboo fountain, facing the east wall, enhancing the natural aesthetic without conflicting with other objects. The shelf is positioned on the west wall, above the bamboo fountain and bonsai, providing storage while maintaining the room's zen aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the placement of the low table in the middle of the room, which interfered with the spatial arrangement of the floor cushions. The length of the floor cushions was insufficient to accommodate the low table, leading to spatial conflicts. To resolve this, the low table and the incense holder, which was intended to be placed on the low table, were removed. This decision was based on the user's preference for a zen garden room with a sand rake set, bamboo fountain, and floor cushions, prioritizing these elements over the low table and incense holder. This resolution maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal, ensuring a harmonious and tranquil environment.
