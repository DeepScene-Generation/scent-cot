## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions an elegant tea room designed for hosting tea gatherings, with a focus on efficient serving and maintaining a sophisticated style. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, is centered around a round wooden table accompanied by upholstered chairs. A tea cart is positioned against the north wall, and the user desires a harmonious color palette and easy movement within the space. The room's design emphasizes seating, serving, and lighting, with a chandelier enhancing the ambiance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main substructures: the Central Seating Area, the Tea Cart Area, and the Lighting Area. The Central Seating Area is the focal point, featuring a round table and chairs for hosting gatherings. The Tea Cart Area, located against the east wall, serves as a functional space for serving and storing tea-related items. The Lighting Area, highlighted by a chandelier, provides ambient lighting to enhance the room's elegant atmosphere.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Central Seating Area, a round wooden table with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 1.2 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended, accompanied by four upholstered chairs, each measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter. The Tea Cart Area features a tea cart with compartments for tea, china, and silverware, measuring 0.627 meters by 0.621 meters by 0.836 meters. The Lighting Area includes a chandelier with dimensions of 0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.5 meters, positioned above the table. Additional items include a 2.0-meter by 2.0-meter rug, a decorative centerpiece, and a wall-mounted clock to complement the room's style.

## 4. Scene Graph
The round table is placed centrally in the room, serving as the focal point for dining and defining the space's purpose. Its dimensions (1.2m x 1.2m x 0.75m) fit comfortably, allowing ample space for movement and additional furnishings. This central placement ensures accessibility from all sides, enhancing functionality and aesthetic appeal.

Chair 1 is positioned in front of the table, facing the south wall. Its placement complements the table's central position, providing a balanced setup. The chair's dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) ensure it fits without overcrowding, maintaining an elegant layout.

Chair 2 is placed opposite Chair 1, behind the table, facing the north wall. This symmetrical arrangement around the table enhances the room's aesthetic appeal and functionality, allowing convenient access for tea service.

Chair 3 is positioned to the left of the table, facing the east wall. This placement maintains balance and symmetry, ensuring all chairs are functional for dining and aesthetically pleasing.

Chair 4 is placed to the right of the table, facing the west wall. This completes the seating arrangement, maintaining symmetry and balance around the table, enhancing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The tea cart is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement keeps the floor space open, ensuring accessibility for serving without disrupting the seating arrangement.

The chandelier is centrally placed above the round table, hanging from the ceiling. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.8m x 0.5m) ensure it provides adequate lighting without interfering with movement or existing furniture.

The rug is centered under the round table and chairs, creating a defined seating area. Its dimensions (2.0m x 2.0m) enhance the room's elegance by adding sophistication and warmth.

The decorative centerpiece is placed on the round table, enhancing the central seating area's aesthetics. Its small size (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.3m) ensures it does not obstruct functionality while adding visual appeal.

The wall clock is mounted on the east wall above the tea cart, facing the west wall. This placement ensures visibility from the seating area, complementing the tea cart and maintaining the room's elegant theme.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were positioned to maintain spatial harmony and adhere to the user's preferences for an elegant tea room. The arrangement ensures functionality and aesthetic appeal, with no need for repositioning or deletion of objects.
