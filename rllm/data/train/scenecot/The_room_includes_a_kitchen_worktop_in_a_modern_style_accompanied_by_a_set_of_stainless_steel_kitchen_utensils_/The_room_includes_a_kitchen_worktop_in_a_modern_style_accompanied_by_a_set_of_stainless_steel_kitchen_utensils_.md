## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a modern kitchen that emphasizes functionality and sleek aesthetics. Essential elements include a kitchen worktop and a set of stainless steel kitchen utensils. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user prefers a modern style, focusing on ergonomic and durable materials, such as polished stone for the worktop and stainless steel for the utensils. Additional preferences include minimalist shelves for storage, modern ceiling lights for adequate illumination, and a central open space for easy movement. The user also expressed interest in a modern bar stool for seating, a decorative fruit bowl, and a small potted plant to introduce a natural element.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The kitchen is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Kitchen Worktop Area is designated for meal preparation, featuring a modern worktop. The Utensil Area is for organizing and displaying stainless steel utensils. The Storage Area includes minimalist shelves for maintaining a clean look. The Lighting Area focuses on ceiling lights to enhance the kitchen's reflective surfaces. The Central Open Space is kept unobstructed for easy movement, ensuring a comfortable and efficient workspace. Additional areas include a Seating Area with a bar stool and a Decorative Area for the fruit bowl and potted plant.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Kitchen Worktop Area, a modern polished stone worktop measuring 2.5 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.9 meters is recommended. The Utensil Area features a stainless steel utensil holder with dimensions of 0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.3 meters. In the Storage Area, two minimalist wooden shelves, each measuring 1.0 meter by 0.3 meters by 0.2 meters, are suggested. The Lighting Area includes a modern metal ceiling light with dimensions of 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters. For the Seating Area, a modern metal bar stool measuring 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.8 meters is recommended. The Decorative Area includes a ceramic fruit bowl (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.1 meters) and a small potted plant.

## 4. Scene Graph
The worktop is a primary element of the kitchen, placed against the north wall to maximize space and provide stability. Its dimensions are 2.5 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.9 meters, and it faces the south wall. This placement allows for additional kitchen elements or seating on the opposite side, aligning with the user's preference for a modern kitchen setup. The utensil holder, a modern stainless steel piece, is placed on the worktop towards one end, ensuring easy access during meal preparation. Its compact size (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.3 meters) avoids spatial conflicts and complements the modern style. 

The first shelf, a minimalist wooden piece, is placed on the north wall to the right of the worktop. Its dimensions are 1.0 meter by 0.3 meters by 0.2 meters, and it faces the south wall, providing accessible storage without obstructing movement. The second shelf, identical in style and material, is placed on the north wall to the left of the first shelf, maintaining balance and maximizing storage. The ceiling light, a modern metal fixture, is centrally placed on the ceiling, ensuring even light distribution across the room. Its dimensions are 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters, and it faces downward to illuminate the worktop area effectively.

The bar stool, a modern metal piece, is placed directly in front of the worktop on the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions are 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.8 meters, providing comfortable seating for meal preparation or casual dining. The fruit bowl, a decorative ceramic item, is centered on the worktop, enhancing its visual appeal without interfering with its primary function. Its dimensions are 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.1 meters. The potted plant, initially intended for the worktop, was removed due to space constraints, ensuring the worktop remains functional and uncluttered.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose when the worktop area was found to be too small to accommodate all intended objects, including the utensil holder, fruit bowl, and potted plant. To resolve this, the potted plant was removed, as it was deemed the least essential for the user's preference and the room's functionality. This decision ensured that the worktop remained functional for meal preparation while maintaining the modern aesthetic desired by the user.
