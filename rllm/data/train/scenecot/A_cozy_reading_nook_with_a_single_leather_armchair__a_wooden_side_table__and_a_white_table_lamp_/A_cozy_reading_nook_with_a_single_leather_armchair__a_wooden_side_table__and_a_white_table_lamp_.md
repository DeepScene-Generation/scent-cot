## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a cozy reading nook within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary elements requested include a leather armchair, a wooden side table, and a table lamp, all contributing to a warm and inviting atmosphere. The user emphasizes comfort and functionality, with the armchair serving as the focal point for relaxation, the side table providing space for books or drinks, and the lamp ensuring adequate lighting. Additional suggestions include a small bookshelf for organizing reading materials, a footrest for added comfort, a rug to define the nook area, and a plant to introduce a touch of nature.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to accommodate the user's requirements. The primary substructure is the Seating Area, centered around the armchair, side table, and lamp, designed for comfort and accessibility. The Storage Area, featuring a bookshelf, is intended for organizing books and maintaining a tidy space. The Decorative Area includes a plant to enhance the room's aesthetic appeal. The floor space is defined by a rug, which ties the seating elements together and adds warmth to the nook.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a classic leather armchair (1.073m x 0.851m x 0.975m) is recommended for its comfort and style. A rustic wooden side table (0.627m x 0.621m x 0.836m) complements the armchair, providing a surface for items. A modern metal table lamp (0.253m x 0.23m x 0.435m) offers functional lighting. The Storage Area features a rustic wooden bookshelf (1.0m x 0.4m x 2.0m) for organizing books. A classic leather footrest (0.621m x 0.481m x 0.461m) enhances comfort in the Seating Area. A modern plant in a ceramic pot (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.0m) adds a decorative touch. A bohemian rug was initially considered to define the space but was removed due to spatial conflicts.

## 4. Scene Graph
The armchair, a central piece for the reading nook, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This positioning creates a sense of enclosure and support, essential for a cozy reading environment. The armchair's dimensions (1.073m x 0.851m x 0.975m) fit comfortably against the wall, ensuring it remains the focal point of the nook. The placement avoids direct sunlight from a hypothetical window on the north wall, preventing glare while reading.

The side table is positioned on the south wall, right of the armchair, ensuring it is within easy reach for someone seated. Its rustic style complements the armchair, and its dimensions (0.627m x 0.621m x 0.836m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing pathways. The table lamp is placed on the side table, providing task lighting while reading. Its compact size (0.253m x 0.23m x 0.435m) ensures no spatial conflicts, enhancing the nook's functionality and ambiance.

The bookshelf is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This location maintains balance and symmetry, with the reading nook's elements grouped together. The bookshelf's dimensions (1.0m x 0.4m x 2.0m) ensure it does not obstruct movement and remains accessible for someone seated in the armchair. The footrest is placed directly in front of the armchair on the rug, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.621m x 0.481m x 0.461m) fit comfortably within the space, enhancing the seating arrangement's comfort.

The plant is placed on the floor, on the east wall, left of the bookshelf. It faces the west wall, contributing to a balanced, cozy reading nook. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.0m) ensure it fits well without obstructing movement or access to the bookshelf.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, a conflict was identified: the length of the side table and armchair was too small to accommodate the rug and footrest in front of them. To resolve this, the rug was removed based on its lower functional priority compared to the armchair, side table, and footrest, ensuring the room remains functional and aligned with the user's preference for a cozy reading nook.
