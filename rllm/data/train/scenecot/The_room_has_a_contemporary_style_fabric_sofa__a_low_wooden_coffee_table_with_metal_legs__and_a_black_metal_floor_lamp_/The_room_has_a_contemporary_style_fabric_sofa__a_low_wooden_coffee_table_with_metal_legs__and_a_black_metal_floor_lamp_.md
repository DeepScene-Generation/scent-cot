## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a contemporary-style living room that incorporates a fabric sofa, a wooden coffee table, and a metal floor lamp. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary focus is on optimizing both functionality and aesthetic appeal. The user has expressed a preference for additional seating, ambient and task lighting, storage solutions, and decorative elements that align with the contemporary theme. The room should facilitate social interaction and provide a comfortable, inviting atmosphere.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Seating Area is centered around the sofa and coffee table, designed for social interaction and relaxation. The Lighting Area includes both ambient and task lighting to enhance functionality and mood. The Storage Area features a sideboard for storing items and displaying decorative pieces. The Decorative Area includes wall art and a decorative plant to enhance the room's aesthetic appeal. Lastly, the Floor Area is defined by an area rug that ties the seating elements together.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a contemporary fabric sofa (2.0m x 0.9m x 0.85m) is recommended, complemented by a wooden coffee table with metal legs (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.4m). The Lighting Area includes a black metal floor lamp (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.5m) and a table lamp for task lighting. The Storage Area features a white wood sideboard (1.5m x 0.4m x 0.8m) for storage and display. The Decorative Area includes a modern canvas wall art (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.8m) and a decorative plant (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.4m) to enhance the room's visual appeal. An area rug (2.5m x 2.5m x 0.02m) is recommended to define the Floor Area and add texture.

## 4. Scene Graph
The sofa is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to maximize space efficiency and provide an anchor point for the seating arrangement. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.9m x 0.85m) allow it to fit comfortably along the wall without overcrowding the room, maintaining a contemporary style and ensuring functionality as a seating area.

The coffee table is positioned in front of the sofa, in the middle of the room, maintaining a functional and aesthetic balance. Its placement ensures easy access from the sofa and does not obstruct pathways, aligning with the user's contemporary style preference.

The floor lamp is placed to the left of the sofa against the south wall, providing ambient lighting to the seating area. Its height (1.5m) ensures it does not obstruct views or movement, complementing the contemporary style and maintaining the room's aesthetic and functional flow.

The sideboard is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall, providing storage and display functionality. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.4m x 0.8m) fit comfortably within the space, balancing the room's visual weight and maintaining the contemporary style.

The area rug is placed on the floor in the middle of the room, with the coffee table on top of it, defining the seating area. Its size (2.5m x 2.5m) ensures it underlies the central area of the seating group, creating a cohesive look that ties the seating elements together.

The wall art is placed above the sofa on the south wall, serving as an aesthetic focal point. Its placement complements the seating arrangement and is easily visible, enhancing the contemporary style of the room.

The decorative plant is placed on the sideboard along the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement ensures it enhances the room's aesthetics without obstructing functionality, adding a touch of greenery to the contemporary design.

The coasters set is placed on the coffee table, centrally located on the table surface. This placement allows for easy access from the seating areas and ensures the table surface is protected while maintaining the room's contemporary style.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts were identified with the armchairs around the coffee table. The width of the coffee table was too small to accommodate both armchairs on either side, leading to spatial conflicts. To resolve this, armchair_1 and armchair_2 were removed, as they were less critical to the room's functionality compared to the other elements. This adjustment ensured the room maintained its contemporary style and functional layout without overcrowding.
