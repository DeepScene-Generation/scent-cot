## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a functional kitchen space that emphasizes efficiency and ease of movement. Essential elements include a stainless steel refrigerator, a cutting board, and a knife holder with knives. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user desires a modern aesthetic with a focus on functionality, ensuring that the kitchen is equipped with necessary appliances and storage solutions while maintaining an uncluttered environment.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The kitchen is divided into several substructures to enhance its functionality and aesthetic appeal. These include the Refrigerator Area for food storage, the Preparation Counter for meal preparation, the Storage Area for organizing kitchen items, and an Open Movement Space to facilitate ease of movement and ventilation. Additional areas include a Cooking Zone for the stove and a Central Island for additional preparation space, ensuring a cohesive and efficient cooking environment.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Refrigerator Area, a modern stainless steel refrigerator is recommended. The Preparation Counter includes a durable wooden cutting board and a modern knife holder. The Storage Area features a modern kitchen cabinet and a metal shelf for organized storage. The Cooking Zone is equipped with a stove, while the Central Island features a modern wooden island counter for additional preparation. A modern lighting fixture is recommended for the ceiling to provide adequate illumination.

## 4. Scene Graph
The refrigerator, a crucial element for food storage, is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions are 0.9 meters by 0.7 meters by 2.0 meters. This placement optimizes space and ensures easy access, aligning with the kitchen's functional requirements. The cutting board, essential for food preparation, is placed on a preparation counter on the south wall, adjacent to the refrigerator, facing the north wall. Its dimensions are 0.4 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.02 meters, ensuring it is accessible and functional within the kitchen space.

The knife holder, intended for holding knives, is placed on the south wall, right of the cutting board, facing the north wall. Its dimensions are 0.2 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.3 meters, allowing for a streamlined food preparation process. The kitchen cabinet, a modern storage solution, is placed on the south wall, left of the refrigerator, facing the north wall. Its dimensions are 1.2 meters by 0.5 meters by 2.0 meters, providing easy access to stored items.

The metal shelf, intended for additional storage, is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions are 1.0 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.4 meters, ensuring accessibility and visibility. The lighting fixture, crucial for illumination, is centrally placed on the ceiling, with dimensions of 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.2 meters, providing even lighting across the kitchen. The island counter, a multifunctional piece for additional preparation, is placed in the middle of the room, oriented parallel to the east and west walls. Its dimensions are 1.5 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.9 meters, maintaining functionality and aesthetic balance.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the placement of the knife holder, initially intended to be left of the cutting board, as the refrigerator occupied that space. The knife holder was repositioned to the right of the cutting board to resolve this. Additionally, the sink was deleted due to spatial constraints and its lower priority compared to other essential elements. The stove was also removed to maintain the room's functionality and align with the user's preference for a functional kitchen space. These adjustments ensured a balanced and efficient kitchen layout, adhering to the user's requirements and design principles.
