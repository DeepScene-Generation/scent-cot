## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires an elegant dining room featuring a dark brown wooden dining table, complementing chairs, and a white chandelier. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for these elements. The focus is on creating an elegant ambiance with a classic style, ensuring the dining table and chairs are the central elements. The chandelier is intended to enhance the room's elegance while providing adequate lighting. Additional elements like a sideboard for storage, a rug to define the dining area, and artwork to add visual interest are also considered to complete the sophisticated look.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The central area is designated for the dining table and chairs, forming the focal point of the room. The ceiling area is reserved for the chandelier, ensuring it provides adequate lighting over the dining setup. The south wall is utilized for the sideboard, offering storage and display space, while the floor area beneath the dining table is defined by a rug to add warmth and texture. The south wall also serves as a backdrop for artwork, enhancing the room's visual appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central dining area, a classic dark brown wooden dining table with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.75 meters is recommended, accompanied by four matching chairs, each measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter. An elegant white chandelier with dimensions of 1.0 meter by 1.0 meter by 0.5 meters is suggested for the ceiling to provide lighting. A classic wool rug, measuring 2.5 meters by 1.5 meters, is recommended to define the dining area. A dark brown wooden sideboard, 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.8 meters, is proposed for the south wall to offer storage. Finally, contemporary artwork, 1.0 meter by 0.1 meter by 0.8 meters, is suggested to be placed above the sideboard to add a modern touch.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dining table is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall, as it is the focal point of the dining area. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.75m) allow it to fit comfortably without overwhelming the space, ensuring accessibility from all sides and maintaining a balanced layout. This central placement aligns with the user's vision of elegance and adheres to design principles by maintaining balance and proportion within the space.

Dining chair 1 is placed to the left of the dining table, facing the east wall. Its classic style and dark brown color match the dining table, ensuring a cohesive aesthetic. The chair's dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably adjacent to the table, maintaining balance and accessibility. Dining chair 2 is positioned to the right of the dining table, facing the west wall, mirroring dining chair 1 to maintain symmetry and balance. Dining chair 3 is placed in front of the dining table, facing the south wall, completing the symmetrical arrangement around the table. Dining chair 4 is positioned behind the dining table, facing the north wall, ensuring all sides of the table are utilized for seating.

The chandelier is placed on the ceiling, directly above the dining table, facing downward to effectively illuminate the dining area. Its dimensions (1.0m x 1.0m x 0.5m) allow it to fit comfortably within the ceiling's height without obstructing movement or view. This placement highlights the chandelier as a central piece, enhancing the overall elegance of the room while providing necessary functionality.

The rug is placed under the dining table and chairs in the middle of the room. Its dimensions (2.5m x 1.5m x 0.02m) allow it to cover the floor area beneath the dining setup, enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the dining area while providing a soft underfoot experience. The beige color of the rug complements the dark brown furniture, providing a balanced and elegant look.

The sideboard is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.5m x 0.8m) allow it to fit comfortably without interfering with the central dining setup. This placement provides balance and makes effective use of space, allowing the sideboard to be functional for storage while maintaining the aesthetic appeal of the room.

The artwork is placed on the south wall above the sideboard, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.1m x 0.8m) make it suitable for wall placement, creating a cohesive visual focal point. This placement does not interfere with the existing chandelier or furniture, adding a modern contrast to the classic style of the room and aligning with the user's vision.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The arrangement of objects respects the room's dimensions and user preferences, ensuring a harmonious and functional layout. The placement of each object adheres to design principles, maintaining balance, proportion, and accessibility throughout the room.
