## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern nursery that incorporates specific items such as a white wooden crib, a soft blue rocking chair, and a playful animal rug. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, is designed to support soothing and feeding activities, safe sleeping, and a soft play area. The aesthetic is modern, with a harmonious color scheme featuring soft hues and playful elements. Safety and ergonomic spacing are emphasized, particularly for infants, ensuring that the room is both functional and visually appealing.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The nursery is divided into three main substructures based on user requirements. The Rocking Chair Area is located near the south wall, designed for soothing and feeding activities. The Crib Area is positioned against the north wall, focusing on safe sleeping. The Play Area is centrally located in the room, providing a space for play and development. Each substructure is purposefully designed to enhance functionality and maintain a modern aesthetic.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Rocking Chair Area, a soft blue rocking chair is recommended, complemented by a small side table for holding items like a baby bottle or book. The Crib Area features a white wooden crib, with a soft mobile for visual stimulation and a storage basket for baby essentials. In the Play Area, a playful animal rug serves as the central element, accompanied by a soft toy storage bin and a baby activity gym to create a safe and engaging environment for play.

## 4. Scene Graph
The crib, a central piece in the nursery, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures stability and safety, aligning with the user's preference for a modern nursery with a white wooden crib. The crib's dimensions (1.4m x 0.8m x 1.0m) fit comfortably against the wall, leaving ample space for other elements. The rocking chair is positioned adjacent to the crib on the south wall, facing the north wall. This arrangement facilitates easy interaction between the caregiver and the crib, maintaining functionality and aesthetics. The rocking chair's dimensions (0.9m x 0.7m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing movement.

The animal rug is placed in the middle of the room, serving as a central play area. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.01m) allow it to be a focal point, enhancing the playful ambiance without interfering with other objects. The mobile is suspended from the ceiling directly above the crib, providing visual stimulation without occupying floor space. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.4m) ensure it complements the nursery's modern theme.

The toy storage bin is placed on the south wall, right of the animal rug, ensuring accessibility during playtime. Its compact size (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.5m) allows it to fit seamlessly into the room's layout. The activity gym is positioned on the floor to the left of the animal rug, in the middle of the room, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 1.0m x 0.5m) ensure it enhances the play area without obstructing movement.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose when attempting to place the side table to the left of the rocking chair, as the crib occupied that space. To resolve this, the side table was repositioned to the right of the rocking chair, maintaining adjacency and functionality. Additionally, the south wall was too small to accommodate all objects, leading to the removal of the storage basket and side table. This decision was based on prioritizing the user's preference for a modern nursery with essential items like the crib, rocking chair, and animal rug, ensuring the room remains functional and aesthetically pleasing.
