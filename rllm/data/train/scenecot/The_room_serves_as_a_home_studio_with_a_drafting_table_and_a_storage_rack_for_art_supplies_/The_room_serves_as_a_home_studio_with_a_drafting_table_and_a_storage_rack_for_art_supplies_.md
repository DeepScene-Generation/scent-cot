## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a home studio primarily focused on art creation, with a drafting table and storage rack as essential elements. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for a well-organized and functional art studio. The user emphasizes the need for a drafting table and storage rack, along with a pinboard for inspiration and an open middle space for flexibility. Additional objects such as a comfortable chair, task lighting, a rug, a small stool, and a waste bin are suggested to enhance functionality and aesthetic appeal. The design should reflect a modern and creative atmosphere, using materials and styles that support artistic activities while maintaining openness and inspiration.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Drafting Table Area is designated for art creation and drafting, positioned to maximize natural light. The Storage Area is intended for organizing art supplies, ensuring easy access and usability. The Pinboard Area is essential for displaying ideas and current projects, providing inspiration. An Artwork Display Area enhances the studio's creative environment, while the Open Middle Space allows for flexibility, enabling the user to work with larger canvases or rearrange the space as needed.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Drafting Table Area, a modern-style drafting table made of light oak wood, measuring 1.5 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.9 meters, is recommended. The Storage Area features an industrial-style metal storage rack, 1.0 meter by 0.5 meter by 2.0 meters, for organizing art supplies. The Pinboard Area includes a contemporary cork pinboard, 2.0 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.0 meter, for displaying ideas. The Artwork Display Area is enhanced with a modern canvas display, 2.5 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.5 meters, for showcasing artwork. A gray ergonomic chair (0.7 meters by 0.535 meters by 0.801 meters) is recommended for comfortable seating at the drafting table. A modern silver task light (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters) provides focused lighting. A bohemian-style multicolor wool rug (2.0 meters by 2.0 meters) defines the open space, while a minimalist wooden stool (0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.5 meters) offers additional seating. A modern black plastic waste bin (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.6 meters) ensures convenience.

## 4. Scene Graph
The drafting table is a crucial element for art creation, placed against the south wall facing the north wall to facilitate ease of use and access to natural light. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.8m x 0.9m) fit well within the room's layout, ensuring it does not obstruct the room's flow and provides ample space for movement. The storage rack, measuring 1.0m x 0.5m x 2.0m, is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement maximizes usability and accessibility for art supplies while keeping the center of the room open for creativity. The pinboard, 2.0m x 0.05m x 1.0m, is mounted on the south wall above the drafting table, ensuring easy access and visibility for the user. The artwork display, 2.5m x 0.05m x 1.5m, is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall, creating an inspiring atmosphere without obstructing the workspace. The ergonomic chair is positioned in front of the drafting table, facing the south wall, ensuring comfortable seating while working. The task light is placed on the drafting table, providing efficient task lighting without obstructing the workspace. The bohemian rug is placed in the middle of the room, under the chair and partially under the drafting table, defining the working area while maintaining functionality. The stool is placed to the right of the drafting table, ensuring it can be used conveniently without interfering with other objects. The waste bin is placed to the left of the drafting table, providing easy access for waste disposal without interrupting the room's workflow.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The room's layout accommodates all objects without spatial conflicts, maintaining balance and proportion while adhering to the user's preferences and functional requirements. The design principles are upheld, ensuring a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing home studio environment.

For artwork_display_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with other objects
        - calculation:
            - Rotation of artwork_display_1: 270.0°
            - No other objects for rotation difference
        - conclusion: No rotation difference calculation needed
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'on' relation
