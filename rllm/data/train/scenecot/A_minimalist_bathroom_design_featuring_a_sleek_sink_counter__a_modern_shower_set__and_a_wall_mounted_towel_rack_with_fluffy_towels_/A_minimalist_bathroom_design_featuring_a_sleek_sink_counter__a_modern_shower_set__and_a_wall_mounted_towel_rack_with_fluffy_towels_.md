## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a minimalist bathroom that emphasizes sleek and modern design elements. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a sink counter, a shower set, and a wall-mounted towel rack, all contributing to an open and uncluttered space. The user prioritizes functionality and aesthetic appeal, with a focus on maintaining a minimalist style through essential objects like a mirror, storage options, and modern lighting fixtures.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The bathroom is divided into several functional substructures based on user requirements. The Sink Area is located on the north wall, providing a space for personal hygiene routines. The Shower Area is on the east wall, enclosed by clear glass to maintain a clean environment. The Towel Area is on the south wall, ensuring easy access to towels. The Storage Area is adjacent to the sink for toiletries, and the Lighting Area is centrally located on the ceiling to enhance visibility. The open middle space enhances the minimalist aesthetic by allowing free movement.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sink Area, a minimalist marble sink counter (1.2m x 0.5m x 0.85m) is recommended. The Shower Area features a modern stainless steel shower set (1.0m x 1.0m x 2.2m). The Towel Area includes a modern metal towel rack (0.6m x 0.15m x 0.1m). A minimalist wood storage cabinet (0.8m x 0.3m x 0.8m) is proposed for the Storage Area. The Lighting Area features a modern metal lighting fixture (0.5m x 0.2m x 0.15m) on the ceiling. Additional elements include a ceramic toilet (0.7m x 0.4m x 0.8m) on the west wall, a cotton bath mat (0.8m x 0.5m x 0.02m) in front of the sink, and a ceramic decorative vase (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.3m) on the sink counter.

## 4. Scene Graph
The sink counter is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, to ensure stability and accessibility while maintaining the minimalist aesthetic. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.5m x 0.85m) fit well against the wall, allowing for easy plumbing access and keeping the room's center open. The shower set is positioned on the east wall, facing the west wall, to allow for proper water drainage and plumbing access. Its modern style complements the minimalist theme, and its placement ensures no interference with the sink counter. The towel rack is mounted on the south wall, facing the north wall, providing easy access from both the sink and shower. Its chrome color complements the stainless steel shower set, enhancing the modern aesthetic. The mirror is placed on the north wall above the sink counter, facing the south wall, to maximize functionality and maintain the minimalist design. The storage cabinet is placed on the north wall, left of the sink counter, facing the south wall, ensuring easy access to toiletries and maintaining a cohesive look. The lighting fixture is mounted centrally on the ceiling to provide even illumination, enhancing visibility and complementing the sleek look of the space. The toilet is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, allowing for necessary plumbing installations and maintaining a visually balanced layout. The bath mat is placed on the floor in front of the sink counter, facing the north wall, providing comfort and aligning with the minimalist design. The decorative vase is placed on the sink counter on the north wall, facing south, adding a decorative element without impeding functionality.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the placement of the shelf_1, which was intended to be placed right of the mirror_1 on the north wall. The width of the mirror was too small to accommodate the shelf without spatial conflict. To resolve this, the shelf_1 was removed, as it was deemed less critical to the user's preference for a minimalist bathroom design featuring a sleek sink counter, a modern shower set, and a wall-mounted towel rack. This decision maintained the room's functionality and aesthetic integrity.

        - conclusion: Final position: x: 4.0229, y: 0.7723, z: 2.925
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=4.0229, y=0.7723, z=2.925

For toilet_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with other objects
        - calculation:
            - Rotation of toilet_1: 90.0°
            - No other objects to compare
        - conclusion: No rotation difference calculation needed
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'on' relation
        - calculation:
            - toilet_1 size: 0.7 (length)
            - Cluster size (on): max(0.0, 0.7) = 0.7
        - conclusion: toilet_1 cluster size (on): 0.7
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'west_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - toilet_1 size: length=0.7, width=0.4, height=0.8
            - x_min = 0 + 0.4/2 = 0.2
            - x_max = 0 + 0.4/2 = 0.2
            - y_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 0.7/2 = 0.35
            - y_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 0.7/2 = 4.65
            - z_min = z_max = 0.8/2 = 0.4
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.2, 0.2, 0.35, 4.65, 0.4, 0.4)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.2-0.2), y(0.35-4.65)
            - Final coordinates: x=0.2, y=2.2431, z=0.4
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.2, y: 2.2431, z: 0.4
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=0.2, y=2.2431, z=0.4
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.2, y: 2.2431, z: 0.4
