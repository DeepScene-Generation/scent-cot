## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a craft corner within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary elements requested include a large wooden craft table, a set of multi-drawer storage units, and an adjustable desk lamp. The emphasis is on creating a well-organized and aesthetically pleasing space that supports crafting activities. Key requirements include ergonomic comfort, harmonious color coordination, and avoiding clutter. Additional considerations include a comfortable chair for extended crafting sessions, a rug for warmth, and a decorative wall clock for time management. The central area of the room should remain unobstructed to allow free movement.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Crafting Area is the focal point, featuring the craft table and associated elements. The Storage Area, initially intended for the storage unit, is adjacent to the crafting space to ensure easy access to materials. The Lighting Area is centered around the desk lamp to provide adequate illumination for detailed work. The Seating Area includes a comfortable chair for prolonged use. The Decorative Area features a rug and a wall clock to enhance the room's aesthetic and functionality. The Open Space in the middle of the room is preserved for movement and accessibility.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Crafting Area, a rustic wooden craft table measuring 2.0 meters by 1.0 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended. The Storage Area was initially to include a multi-drawer storage unit, but due to spatial constraints, it was removed. The Lighting Area features a modern metal desk lamp (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters) placed on the craft table. The Seating Area includes an ergonomic fabric chair (0.7 meters by 0.535 meters by 0.801 meters) for comfort. The Decorative Area is enhanced by a bohemian wool rug (2.0 meters by 1.5 meters by 0.01 meters) and a vintage wooden wall clock (0.3 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.3 meters). A functional cork pinboard (0.566 meters by 0.019 meters by 0.892 meters) and a modern ceramic pot plant (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.6 meters) are also recommended for organization and decoration.

## 4. Scene Graph
The craft table, a central element of the craft corner, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This positioning maximizes floor space and accessibility, aligning with the user's preference for an open and functional craft area. The table's rustic style and natural wood color complement the room's aesthetic, while its dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.75m) ensure it fits comfortably against the wall without obstructing movement.

The desk lamp, a crucial accessory for crafting, is placed on the right side of the craft table. This placement ensures optimal lighting for the workspace without interfering with the user's activities. The lamp's modern style and compact size (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) allow it to fit seamlessly on the table, enhancing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The ergonomic chair is positioned to the right of the craft table, facing the west wall. This placement facilitates comfortable crafting sessions and maintains easy access to the table. The chair's dimensions (0.7m x 0.535m x 0.801m) and gray fabric material align with the room's design principles, ensuring balance and proportion.

The bohemian rug is placed under the craft table, extending slightly beyond to accommodate the chair. This placement defines the crafting area and adds warmth and comfort to the space. The rug's multicolor design and dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.01m) enhance the room's aesthetic without compromising functionality.

The vintage wall clock is mounted on the south wall, providing a focal point visible from the craft table. This placement aids in time management during crafting activities and complements the rustic style of the craft table. The clock's dimensions (0.3m x 0.05m x 0.3m) ensure it does not occupy floor space, maintaining the room's openness.

The pinboard is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. This location ensures it is easily accessible from the craft table, enhancing the functionality of the craft corner. The pinboard's functional style and cork material provide a practical solution for organizing ideas.

The plant is placed on the craft table, facing the south wall. Its small size (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) and modern style add a natural element to the room without obstructing the workspace. This placement enhances the craft corner's aesthetic, contributing to a pleasant and inspiring environment.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited width of the craft table, which could not accommodate the storage unit to its left. To resolve this, the storage unit was removed, prioritizing the craft table's central role in the craft corner. This decision aligns with the user's preference for a functional and spacious crafting area, ensuring the room remains uncluttered and aesthetically pleasing.
