## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a formal dining room centered around a grand rectangular table with upholstered chairs, emphasizing elegance and functionality. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, is intended for formal dinners, requiring storage and decorative elements. The user desires a classic aesthetic, with a focus on a formal dinner setup, proper lighting, and space for movement, ensuring the room remains both sophisticated and practical.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key substructures to meet the user's requirements. The central area is designated for the dining table and chairs, forming the core of the dining setup. The south wall is allocated for an ornate sideboard, providing storage and a surface for decorative items. The ceiling is reserved for a chandelier to enhance ambient lighting. Additionally, the walls are utilized for artwork to add sophistication and visual interest, ensuring the room's design is cohesive and elegant.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the dining area, a classic mahogany dining table measuring 3.0 meters by 1.2 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended, accompanied by four upholstered chairs, each 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter, to provide comfortable seating. The ornate sideboard, also in mahogany, measures 1.8 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter, offering storage and decorative space. A classic crystal chandelier, 0.494 meters by 0.494 meters by 1.24 meters, is suggested for the ceiling to provide elegant lighting. For decoration, four pieces of classic artwork, each 1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 0.7 meters, are recommended to enhance the room's aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dining table is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall, as it is the focal point of the formal dining setup. Its dimensions (3.0m x 1.2m x 0.75m) allow it to fit comfortably in the middle, providing symmetry and balance, essential for a classic dining room. This central placement ensures ample space for movement and aligns with the user's preference for a grand table.

The first dining chair is positioned in front of the table, facing the south wall, maintaining a balanced and functional dining setup. Its placement adjacent to the table ensures accessibility and visual harmony, complementing the table's classic style. The second chair is placed behind the table, facing the north wall, to maintain symmetry and balance, aligning with traditional dining room layouts. The third chair is placed to the right of the table, facing the west wall, ensuring no spatial conflicts and maintaining a balanced aesthetic. The fourth chair is placed to the left of the table, facing the east wall, completing the classic arrangement of chairs around the table, ensuring symmetry and ease of access.

The ornate sideboard is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, providing storage and a decorative surface. Its dimensions (1.8m x 0.5m x 1.0m) fit well along the wall, complementing the dining setup without obstructing movement. The chandelier is centrally placed above the dining table, providing even lighting and enhancing the room's elegance. Its placement on the ceiling ensures it does not interfere with other objects, aligning with the user's preference for a formal dining room.

Artwork is strategically placed to enhance the room's aesthetic. Artwork_1 is on the north wall, facing the south wall, providing visual interest without overwhelming the design. Artwork_2 is on the east wall, facing the west wall, adding balance and avoiding redundancy. Artwork_3 is on the west wall, facing the east wall, completing the decorative aspect of the room. Artwork_4 is placed above the sideboard on the south wall, facing the north wall, utilizing vertical space effectively and maintaining a cohesive design.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The layout accommodates all objects without spatial conflicts, ensuring the room remains functional and aesthetically pleasing. The placement of each object aligns with the user's preferences and design principles, maintaining balance and elegance throughout the room.
