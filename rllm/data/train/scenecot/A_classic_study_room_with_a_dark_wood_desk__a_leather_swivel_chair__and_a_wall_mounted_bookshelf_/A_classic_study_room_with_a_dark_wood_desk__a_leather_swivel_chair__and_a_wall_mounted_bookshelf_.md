## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a classic study room characterized by a dark wood desk, a leather swivel chair, and a wall-mounted bookshelf. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for a functional and aesthetically pleasing arrangement. The user's preferences lean towards a classic style, emphasizing the need for a workspace area, storage solutions, and additional elements like lighting and decor to enhance the room's functionality and classic theme.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key substructures to accommodate the user's requirements. The Workspace Area includes the desk and chair, forming the central zone for productivity. The Bookshelf Area is designated for storage, featuring a wall-mounted bookshelf. Additional substructures include the Lighting Area, which focuses on providing adequate illumination for the workspace, and the Decor Area, which enhances the room's classic aesthetic with elements like a rug, artwork, and a plant.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Workspace Area, a classic dark wood desk measuring 1.8 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended, accompanied by a leather swivel chair with dimensions of 0.7 meters by 0.7 meters by 1.2 meters. The Bookshelf Area features a wall-mounted bookshelf made of dark brown wood, measuring 2.0 meters by 0.3 meters by 2.5 meters. The Lighting Area includes a metal desk lamp in antique brass and a ceramic table lamp, both placed on the desk to provide functional and decorative lighting. The Decor Area is enhanced with a wool rug (3.0 meters by 2.0 meters), a classic canvas artwork, and a plant in a ceramic pot, adding warmth and visual interest to the room.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dark wood desk is a central element in the classic study room, placed against the north wall to face the south wall. This placement ensures the desk is a focal point, adhering to the user's vision and design principles of balance and proportion. The desk's dimensions (1.8m x 0.9m x 0.75m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, providing ample workspace while maintaining accessibility and aesthetic appeal.

The leather swivel chair is positioned directly in front of the desk, facing the north wall. This placement ensures the chair complements the desk, providing comfortable seating for work. The chair's dimensions (0.7m x 0.7m x 1.2m) allow it to fit seamlessly in front of the desk without spatial conflicts, maintaining the room's classic style and functional layout.

The wall-mounted bookshelf is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. This location provides easy access to books from the desk area, enhancing functionality. The bookshelf's dimensions (2.0m x 0.3m x 2.5m) ensure it occupies significant vertical space without interfering with other elements, maintaining balance and accessibility in the room.

The desk lamp, made of metal with an antique brass finish, is placed on the desk to provide adequate lighting for the workspace. Its compact size (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.5m) allows it to fit comfortably on the desk, ensuring functional lighting while complementing the classic aesthetic.

The table lamp, a classic-style decorative piece, is also placed on the desk, next to the desk lamp. Its dimensions (0.253m x 0.23m x 0.435m) ensure it fits without crowding the workspace, providing additional lighting and decorative appeal.

The wool rug is placed in the middle of the room, under the chair and partially under the desk. Its dimensions (3.0m x 2.0m) allow it to anchor the furniture, creating a cohesive and comfortable workspace. The rug's burgundy color adds warmth and contrast to the room's darker elements.

The classic canvas artwork is mounted on the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.5m) allow it to serve as a focal point, enhancing the room's aesthetic without conflicting with other objects.

The plant, in a ceramic pot, is placed in the southeast corner of the room, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.2m) ensure it adds vertical interest and greenery without obstructing pathways or workspace functionality.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The objects were arranged to ensure optimal functionality and aesthetic appeal, adhering to the user's preferences and design principles. The placement of each object was carefully considered to avoid spatial conflicts and maintain the room's classic style.
