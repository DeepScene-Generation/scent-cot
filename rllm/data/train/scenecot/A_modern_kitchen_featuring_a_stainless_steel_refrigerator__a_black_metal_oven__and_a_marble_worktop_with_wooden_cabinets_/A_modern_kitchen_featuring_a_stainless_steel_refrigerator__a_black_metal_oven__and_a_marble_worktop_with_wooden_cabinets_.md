## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a modern kitchen with specific elements, including a stainless steel refrigerator, a black metal oven, a marble worktop, and wooden cabinets. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for both functionality and aesthetics. The user emphasizes a modern aesthetic, with a preference for a spacious and accessible layout that allows for easy movement and interaction with kitchen appliances. Additional elements like bar stools, a kitchen island, and a lighting fixture are considered to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The kitchen is divided into distinct zones based on the user's requirements: the Refrigerator Zone for food storage, the Oven Zone for cooking and baking, the Marble Worktop Zone for meal preparation, the Cabinet Storage Zone for storing kitchen essentials, and the Central Open Space for movement and accessibility. Each zone is designed to fulfill specific functional needs while maintaining the modern aesthetic desired by the user.

This placement maintains a practical work triangle with the refrigerator and worktop, ensuring accessibility and functionality. The oven's dimensions are 0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.9 meters, fitting well within the room's layout without blocking pathways.

The marble worktop is placed along the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions are 2.0 meters in length, 1.0 meter in width, and 0.9 meters in height, providing a central area for meal preparation. This placement ensures proximity to the oven for ease of cooking and maintains an open area for movement.

The wooden cabinet is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, adjacent to the worktop. Its dimensions are 2.5 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.9 meters, providing ample storage space while maintaining a cohesive look with the worktop and refrigerator. This placement enhances functionality and aligns with the modern aesthetic.

Two bar stools are placed in front of the worktop, facing the north wall. Each stool measures 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.75 meters, providing functional seating without causing spatial conflicts. The stools complement the worktop for meal preparation and seating purposes, maintaining the modern kitchen theme.

The kitchen island is centrally placed in the room, providing additional workspace while maintaining accessibility and style. Its dimensions are 1.2 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.9 meters, fitting comfortably in the center without obstructing movement. This placement enhances the kitchen's functionality and complements the modern design.

The lighting fixture is mounted on the ceiling in the middle of the room, providing even ambient lighting across the kitchen.
