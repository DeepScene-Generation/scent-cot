## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a tranquil meditation space characterized by a minimalist and serene environment. Key elements include a light-colored tatami mat, a small wooden altar, and a bamboo plant in a ceramic pot. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, is intended to foster calmness through natural elements. Additional recommendations include meditation cushions, a low shelf for storage, a small water feature, ambient lighting, and calming wall art. These elements should harmonize with the minimalist aesthetic, enhancing the room's tranquility without cluttering the space.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The central Tatami Mat Area serves as the primary meditation surface. The Altar Area, located against the north wall, is designated for spiritual practices. The Natural Decor Area, featuring the bamboo plant, enhances the room's tranquility. The Storage Area, along the west wall, provides space for meditation items. The Lighting Area, near the north and east walls, ensures soft illumination. Finally, the Art Display Area on the south wall adds visual calmness to the space.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Tatami Mat Area, a large, light beige tatami mat (4.5m x 4.5m) is recommended to cover most of the floor. The Altar Area features a traditional wooden altar (1.15m x 0.398m x 2.152m) for spiritual practices. The Natural Decor Area includes a bamboo plant in a ceramic pot (0.229m x 0.177m x 1.2m) to add freshness. The Storage Area is equipped with a modern, light wood low shelf (1.0m x 0.3m x 0.5m) for storing meditation items. The Lighting Area includes a minimalist ambient light (0.453m x 0.367m x 1.5m) for soft illumination. The Art Display Area features contemporary wall art (0.95m x 0.02m x 1.4m) with a calming blue and white color scheme. Additionally, meditation cushions (0.67m x 0.392m x 0.282m) and an incense holder (0.196m x 0.196m x 0.328m) are recommended for seating and aromatherapy.

## 4. Scene Graph
The tatami mat is placed centrally on the floor, serving as the main meditation surface. Its dimensions (4.5m x 4.5m x 0.02m) allow it to cover most of the room, providing a soft and calming surface. The mat's light beige color complements the tranquil aesthetic, and its central placement ensures it is the focal point, allowing for harmonious placement of other objects around it.

The wooden altar is positioned against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement respects traditional practices and ensures the altar does not obstruct the openness of the tatami mat. The altar's natural wood color enhances the room's aesthetic, and its dimensions (1.15m x 0.398m x 2.152m) ensure it fits comfortably against the wall without spatial conflicts.

The bamboo plant is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (0.229m x 0.177m x 1.2m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing views or movement. This placement enhances the room's natural decor, contributing to the tranquil ambiance without interfering with the tatami mat or altar.

The first meditation cushion is placed centrally on the tatami mat, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.67m x 0.392m x 0.282m) ensure it fits comfortably, enhancing comfort during meditation. The second cushion is placed beside the first, maintaining balance and symmetry, allowing for meditation facing the altar.

The low shelf is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.3m x 0.5m) ensure it fits without interfering with other objects. This placement provides accessible storage for meditation items while maintaining the room's openness and serenity.

The ambient light is positioned near the corner of the north and east walls, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.453m x 0.367m x 1.5m) ensure it does not obstruct other elements, providing soft lighting to the altar and tatami mat area, enhancing the room's tranquil and minimalist style.

The wall art is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.95m x 0.02m x 1.4m) allow it to stand out as a focal point, enhancing the room's atmosphere without obstructing pathways or functional areas.

The incense holder is placed on the wooden altar, facing south. Its small size (0.196m x 0.196m x 0.328m) ensures it does not obstruct other objects, enhancing the spiritual and aromatic ambiance of the meditation space.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the placement of the bamboo plant and the water feature. The width of the bamboo plant was too small to accommodate the water feature to its left. To resolve this, the water feature was removed, as the bamboo plant is more essential to the user's preference for a tranquil meditation space. This adjustment ensures the room maintains its intended functionality and aesthetic without unnecessary clutter.
