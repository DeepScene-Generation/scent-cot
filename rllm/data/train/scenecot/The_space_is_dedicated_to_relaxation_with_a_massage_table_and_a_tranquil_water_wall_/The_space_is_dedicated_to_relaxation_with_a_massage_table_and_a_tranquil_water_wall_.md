## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a room dedicated to relaxation, emphasizing a tranquil atmosphere facilitated by a massage table and a water wall. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary function is to create a serene environment, with the massage table and water wall as essential components. The user prefers a modern aesthetic, incorporating elements like calming artwork and soft lighting to enhance the room's tranquility. Additional considerations include seating and storage for massage supplies, ensuring the room remains functional and aesthetically pleasing.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to meet the user's relaxation requirements. The central area is designated for the massage table, ensuring easy access and ergonomic comfort. The south wall is reserved for the water wall, a key feature for creating a calming atmosphere. The north wall is intended for decorative elements like artwork, enhancing the visual appeal. The ceiling is utilized for ambient lighting, contributing to the room's tranquil ambiance. The east wall is allocated for storage, providing convenient access to massage supplies without disrupting the room's flow.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central area, a modern-style massage table made of wood and leather, measuring 2.0 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.7 meters, is recommended. The south wall features a modern glass and metal water wall, 2.5 meters in length, enhancing the calming atmosphere. The north wall is adorned with minimalist artwork in soft pastels, measuring 1.5 meters by 0.1 meters by 1.0 meter, to complement the room's aesthetic. A modern ceiling light, 0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.3 meters, provides ambient lighting. A modern wooden storage cabinet, 1.0 meter by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter, is placed against the east wall for storing massage supplies. A modern chair, 0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.0 meter, offers seating, while a modern floor lamp, 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.5 meters, provides task lighting.

## 4. Scene Graph
The massage table is centrally placed in the room, facing the north wall, as it is the focal piece for relaxation. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.8m x 0.7m) allow for a balanced and proportionate placement, ensuring easy access and a view of the water wall. This central placement adheres to design principles, promoting relaxation and symmetry.

The water wall, a key feature for a calming atmosphere, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (2.5m x 0.3m x 2.5m) fit well on the south wall, ensuring it is a prominent feature without obstructing the massage table. This placement enhances the room's aesthetic and functionality, aligning with the user's vision for a relaxing space.

The artwork is placed on the north wall, facing south, ensuring visibility from the massage table. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.1m x 1.0m) are appropriate for the wall, complementing the room's elements and enhancing the visual appeal without disrupting the focus on relaxation.

The ceiling light is centrally mounted on the ceiling, providing ambient lighting. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.3m) ensure even illumination throughout the room, enhancing the tranquil atmosphere and complementing the modern decor.

The storage cabinet is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.5m x 1.0m) allow for convenient access to massage supplies without disrupting the room's flow. The cabinet's light wood color complements the existing elements, enhancing the overall aesthetic.

The chair is placed to the right of the massage table, facing the east wall. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 1.0m) fit well within the available space, providing functional seating without obstructing the view of the water wall or artwork.

The floor lamp is placed left of the massage table, facing the north wall, providing task lighting. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.5m) ensure it does not obstruct movement or sight lines, enhancing the relaxing atmosphere and complementing the room's balance.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed considering spatial relationships and user preferences, ensuring a harmonious and functional relaxation space. The room's design remains balanced and inviting, with each element contributing to the overall tranquil atmosphere.
