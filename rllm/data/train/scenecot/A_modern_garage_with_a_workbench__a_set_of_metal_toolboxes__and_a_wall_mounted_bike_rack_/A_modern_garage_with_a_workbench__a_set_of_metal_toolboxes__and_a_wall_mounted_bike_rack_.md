## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern garage with specific functional areas, including a workbench area, tool storage with metal toolboxes, and a wall-mounted bike rack. The garage is designed to be sleek and organized, avoiding visual clutter while maximizing utility. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes the need for a modern aesthetic, efficient lighting, and additional elements like seating for comfort and open space for maneuverability.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The garage is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Workbench Area is designated along the north wall for DIY projects. The Tool Storage Area includes metal toolboxes and a pegboard for organized tool access. The Bike Storage Area features a wall-mounted bike rack on the south wall. The Lighting Area involves an overhead lighting system for optimal illumination. Additional space is allocated for seating and open maneuverability to enhance functionality.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Workbench Area, a modern light gray wooden workbench measuring 2.0 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.9 meters is recommended. The Tool Storage Area includes a red metal toolbox (0.8 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meters) and a pegboard for tool organization. The Bike Storage Area features a black metal wall-mounted bike rack (0.853 meters by 0.432 meters by 1.055 meters). The Lighting Area is equipped with a modern white plastic ceiling light (0.447 meters by 0.441 meters by 0.876 meters). A modern gray metal shelf (1.012 meters by 0.512 meters by 2.0 meters) is suggested for additional storage, and a minimalist black rubber mat (1.581 meters by 1.621 meters by 0.0049 meters) is recommended for floor protection.

## 4. Scene Graph
The bike rack is mounted on the south wall, facing the north wall, as it utilizes vertical space efficiently and aligns with the modern garage aesthetic. Its dimensions (0.853m x 0.432m x 1.055m) ensure it does not occupy floor space, allowing for better use of the garage area. The workbench is placed along the north wall, facing the south wall, providing a stable and accessible workspace. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.8m x 0.9m) fit well along the wall, ensuring no obstruction to the bike rack on the south wall. The toolbox is placed on the north wall, right of the workbench, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.5m x 1.0m) allow it to be adjacent to the workbench, providing a functional and aesthetic addition to the garage. The light fixture is centrally located on the ceiling, providing even illumination across the garage. Its dimensions (0.447m x 0.441m x 0.876m) ensure it does not interfere with any objects on the floor or walls. The shelf is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, providing accessible storage and maintaining room balance. Its dimensions (1.012m x 0.512m x 2.0m) ensure it does not clutter the space. The mat is placed in the middle of the room, providing floor protection without interfering with other objects. Its dimensions (1.581m x 1.621m x 0.0049m) support the functionality of the room as a workspace.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to the limited space on the north wall, which could not accommodate all intended objects. The pegboard's width was insufficient to accommodate the hook, leading to the decision to delete the hook based on its lower priority. Additionally, the north wall's length was inadequate for all objects, resulting in the removal of the stool, pegboard, and second toolbox to maintain the user's preference for a modern garage with a workbench, toolboxes, and a bike rack. These adjustments ensured the room remained functional and aligned with the user's aesthetic vision.
