## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a rustic home entryway featuring specific furniture pieces: a wooden bench, a coat rack, and a wicker shoe rack. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user's preferences emphasize a rustic aesthetic, characterized by cohesive materials, textures, and visual warmth. Functionally, the bench provides seating, the coat rack offers hanging space, and the shoe rack ensures organized storage. The design aims to keep the middle of the room open for movement, aligning with the user's desire for a functional and aesthetically pleasing entryway.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The entryway is divided into specific areas based on the user's requirements. The Wooden Bench Area is located on the south wall, serving as the primary seating zone. Adjacent to the bench is the Coat Rack Area, providing convenient access for hanging outerwear. The Wicker Shoe Rack Area is positioned on the north wall, ensuring easy storage of footwear. These substructures are designed to align with the user's input and the functional needs of the entryway.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Wooden Bench Area, a rustic wooden bench measuring 1.5 meters in length, 0.5 meters in width, and 0.45 meters in height is recommended. The Coat Rack Area features a traditional wooden coat rack with dimensions of 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.8 meters, complementing the bench. The Wicker Shoe Rack Area includes a rustic wicker shoe rack measuring 1.2 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.6 meters. Additional recommendations include a rustic-style mirror with an antique finish, a bohemian-style rug, and decorative elements like a vase and a plant to enhance the rustic theme and provide added utility.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden bench is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, as it is a functional piece for seating in an entryway. This placement is immediately accessible upon entering the room, maintaining open floor space and aligning with the rustic style. The bench's dimensions (1.5m x 0.5m x 0.45m) ensure it fits comfortably without crowding the space.

The coat rack is positioned to the left of the bench along the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures functional coherence and ease of use, as it is adjacent to the bench. The coat rack's dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.8m) fit comfortably within the room's height, maintaining balance and functional grouping.

The shoe rack is placed on the south wall, right of the bench, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.4m x 0.6m) allow it to fit comfortably, providing easy access for shoe storage. This placement maintains a cohesive layout and flow, complementing the rustic aesthetic.

The mirror is placed above the bench on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.05m x 1.2m) fit comfortably above the bench, providing a practical location for appearance checks. This placement enhances the rustic theme and complements the existing layout.

The rug is placed in the middle of the room, oriented to align symmetrically with the south wall. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.01m) ensure it enhances the space without overcrowding, adding warmth and texture to the rustic theme.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified due to the south wall being too small to accommodate all objects, including the side table, bench, coat rack, shoe rack, and plant. To resolve this, the side table, vase, and plant were removed based on their lower functional priority compared to the bench, coat rack, and shoe rack, which are essential for the user's rustic entryway vision. This adjustment ensures the room remains functional and aesthetically aligned with the user's preferences.
