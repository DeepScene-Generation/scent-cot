        - calculation:
            - mirror_1 size: 1.0 (length)
            - Cluster size (south_wall): max(0.0, 1.0) = 1.0
        - conclusion: mirror_1 cluster size (south_wall): 1.0
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'south_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - mirror_1 size: length=1.0, width=0.05, height=1.5
            - x_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 1.0/2 = 0.5
            - x_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 1.0/2 = 4.5
            - y_min = 0 + 0.05/2 = 0.025
            - y_max = 0 + 0.05/2 = 0.025
            - z_min = 1.5 - 3.0/2 + 1.5/2 = 0.75
            - z_max = 1.5 + 3.0/2 - 1.5/2 = 2.25
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.5, 4.5, 0.025, 0.025, 0.75, 2.25)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.5-4.5), y(0.025-0.025)
            - Final coordinates: x=2.459968315579649, y=0.025, z=0.8678036000227463
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 2.459968315579649, y: 0.025, z: 0.8678036000227463
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=2.459968315579649, y=0.025, z=0.8678036000227463
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 2.459968315579649, y: 0.025, z: 0.8678036000227463
