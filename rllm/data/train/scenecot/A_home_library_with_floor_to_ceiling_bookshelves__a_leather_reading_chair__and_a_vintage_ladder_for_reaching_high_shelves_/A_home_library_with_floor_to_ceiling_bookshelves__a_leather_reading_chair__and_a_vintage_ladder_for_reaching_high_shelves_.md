## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a home library characterized by floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, a leather reading chair, and a vintage ladder for accessing high shelves. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design emphasizes accessibility, comfort, and a timeless aesthetic, with a preference for vintage elements. The library should include essential components such as bookshelves, a reading chair, a side table, a brass lamp, and a vintage ladder, while additional items like a rug, plant, ottoman, and decorative globe are considered to enhance functionality and aesthetics.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Bookshelf Area includes floor-to-ceiling bookshelves on the north and south walls, maximizing storage and display space. The Ladder System is designed to provide access to high shelves, primarily on the north wall. The Reading Chair Area is centrally located, offering a comfortable space for reading. The Lighting Area focuses on providing adequate illumination for reading, while the Decorative Area includes elements like a globe and plant to enhance the library's aesthetic.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Bookshelf Area, vintage-style bookshelves made of dark wood are recommended, with dimensions of 5.0 meters by 0.4 meters by 3.0 meters for the north wall and 1.0 meter by 0.4 meters by 3.0 meters for the south wall. The Ladder System features a vintage ladder, ensuring access to high shelves. The Reading Chair Area includes a classic leather reading chair (1.073 meters by 0.851 meters by 0.975 meters) and a side table for convenience. A brass lamp is suggested for the Lighting Area, while a decorative globe and plant are proposed for the Decorative Area to enhance the library's vintage theme.

## 4. Scene Graph
The bookshelf on the south wall, measuring 1.0 meter in length, 0.4 meters in width, and 3.0 meters in height, is placed to provide additional storage space while maintaining the design intent of having bookshelves on both the north and south walls. This placement ensures functionality for accessing books from either side of the room and aligns with the user's preference for a vintage aesthetic.

The reading chair, with dimensions of 1.073 meters by 0.851 meters by 0.975 meters, is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. This positioning creates a natural reading position towards the main bookshelf and ensures it aligns with the room's layout. The chair is positioned to the left of the south wall bookshelf, ensuring no overlap with other objects and maintaining a clear path for the ladder.

## 5. Global Check
Several conflicts arose during the placement process. The side table was too small to accommodate both the lamp and the globe, leading to the removal of the globe to prioritize functionality and user preference for a classic home library. Additionally, the south wall could not accommodate all intended objects, resulting in the removal of the ottoman, plant, rug, and side table to maintain the primary focus on the reading chair and bookshelf. The north wall also faced space constraints, necessitating the removal of the ladder to prioritize the bookshelf, which is central to the user's vision of a home library with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves.
