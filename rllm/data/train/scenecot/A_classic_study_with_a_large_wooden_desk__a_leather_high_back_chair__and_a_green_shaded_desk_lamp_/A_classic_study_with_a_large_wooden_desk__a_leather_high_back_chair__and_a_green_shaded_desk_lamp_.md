## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a classic study room that exudes a traditional and intellectual ambiance. Essential elements include a large wooden desk, a leather high-back chair, and a green-shaded desk lamp. The room's dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes a structured space conducive to focused study, with a preference for traditional styling and adequate lighting. Additional storage solutions like a bookshelf or cabinets are suggested to maintain organization, while decorative elements such as a globe, rug, and bookends enhance the room's classic aesthetic. A floor lamp and a small indoor plant are recommended to add warmth and a touch of nature.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures. The Study Area is the primary zone, featuring the wooden desk and leather chair for focused work. The Lighting Area includes the desk lamp and floor lamp to ensure adequate illumination. The Storage Area, with a bookshelf, is designated for organizing study materials. The Decorative Area incorporates elements like the globe, rug, and bookends to enhance the room's classic aesthetic. Lastly, the Natural Element Area is intended for the indoor plant, adding a touch of nature to the space.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Study Area, a classic wooden desk (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.8m) and a leather high-back chair (1.073m x 0.851m x 0.975m) are recommended. The Lighting Area features a green-shaded desk lamp (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) and a brass floor lamp (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.8m). The Storage Area includes a classic wooden bookshelf (0.859m x 0.224m x 1.979m) for organizing books. The Decorative Area is enhanced with a globe (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.4m), a burgundy rug (2.827m x 2.13m), and bronze bookends (0.15m x 0.15m x 0.2m). The Natural Element Area features a small indoor plant to add greenery.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden desk is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, serving as the central piece in the room. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.8m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing pathways, making it a focal point in the classic study setup. The leather chair is positioned in front of the desk, facing the south wall, ensuring functional seating for study or work. Its dimensions (1.073m x 0.851m x 0.975m) fit well within the available space, complementing the desk's classic style.

The desk lamp is placed on top of the wooden desk, facing the north wall, to provide task lighting. Its compact size (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) ensures it does not interfere with the chair's placement. The bookshelf is positioned against the west wall, facing the east wall, providing easy access to books and study materials. Its dimensions (0.859m x 0.224m x 1.979m) fit well against the wall, harmonizing with the desk and chair.

The globe is placed on the wooden desk, complementing the desk lamp and contributing to the classic study aesthetic. Its small size (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.4m) ensures no obstruction to the chair's seating position. The rug is placed centrally in the room, under the desk and chair setup, with its longer side parallel to the south wall. Its dimensions (2.827m x 2.13m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing movement.

The bookends are placed on the bookshelf, facing the east wall, enhancing organization and maintaining the classic aesthetic. Their small size (0.15m x 0.15m x 0.2m) ensures they fit well on the shelves. The floor lamp is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, to the left of the wooden desk. Its height (1.8m) ensures it provides adequate lighting without obstructing the desk's functionality.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the placement of the indoor plant, as the width of the bookshelf was too small to accommodate it on the west wall. Given the user's preference for a classic study with a focus on the desk, chair, and lamp, the indoor plant was deemed less critical and removed to resolve the conflict. This decision maintained the room's functionality and aesthetic, ensuring a harmonious and organized study environment.
