## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user has expressed a desire to transform a 5.0m x 5.0m x 3.0m room into an artist's studio. Essential elements include a sturdy easel, a functional workbench, and bright spotlights to create a conducive environment for creativity and productivity. Additionally, the user implicitly requires storage solutions, seating, and areas for inspiration and display to enhance both the functionality and aesthetics of the studio. The room's layout, with designated walls and a ceiling, offers flexibility for strategic object placement to maximize space efficiency.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The central area is designated for the easel, serving as the focal point for art creation and display. The south wall is allocated for the workbench, essential for organizing and preparing art materials. The ceiling is reserved for spotlights to ensure adequate lighting throughout the studio. Additional substructures include the east wall for storage shelves, providing space for art supplies, and the west wall for a display board, offering an area for showcasing artwork and inspiration.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central area, a modern-style wooden easel with dimensions of 0.8m x 0.6m x 2.0m is recommended to serve as the primary art creation and display point. Along the south wall, an industrial-style metal workbench measuring 2.0m x 0.8m x 0.9m is suggested for mixing paints and organizing materials. The ceiling will feature three contemporary metal spotlights, each measuring 0.235m x 0.045m x 0.045m, to provide adjustable lighting. A minimalist wooden stool (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.6m) is recommended for seating near the workbench. For storage, a modern wooden shelf (1.0m x 0.3m x 2.0m) is proposed for the east wall, while a modern cork display board (1.2m x 0.05m x 1.5m) is suggested for the west wall to display artwork and inspiration.

## 4. Scene Graph
The easel is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, to serve as the central element for art creation and display. This placement ensures optimal lighting and accessibility, aligning with typical studio setups where the artist can step back to view their work. The easel's dimensions (0.8m x 0.6m x 2.0m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing movement, making it a functional centerpiece of the room.

The workbench is positioned on the south wall, facing the north wall, providing a balanced setup close to the easel. This placement ensures easy access for organizing materials and mixing paints, while leaving ample space for movement between the workbench and easel. The workbench's dimensions (2.0m x 0.8m x 0.9m) complement the room's layout, maintaining balance and proportion.

Spotlight_1, spotlight_2, and spotlight_3 are mounted on the ceiling, centrally located to provide even and adjustable lighting across the studio. Their placement ensures no spatial conflicts, as they do not occupy floor space, and they align with the user's preference for a bright studio environment. The spotlights' dimensions (0.235m x 0.045m x 0.045m) are compact, allowing them to blend seamlessly into the ceiling while providing optimal lighting coverage.

The stool is placed in front of the workbench, facing the south wall, to offer convenient seating for the artist. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.6m) allow it to fit comfortably under the workbench when not in use, ensuring the space remains uncluttered and functional.

The storage shelf is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall, to provide accessible storage for art supplies. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.3m x 2.0m) make it suitable for wall placement, ensuring stability and easy access without interfering with the functionality of the workbench or easel.

Finally, the display board is positioned on the west wall, facing the east wall, to serve as a dedicated area for displaying artwork and inspiration. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.05m x 1.5m) allow it to fit comfortably along the wall without obstructing movement or functionality within the studio.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The arrangement of objects within the room adheres to the user's requirements and design principles, ensuring a functional and aesthetically pleasing artist's studio. The strategic placement of each object maintains balance and proportion, allowing for efficient use of space and enhancing the studio's overall functionality and visual appeal.
