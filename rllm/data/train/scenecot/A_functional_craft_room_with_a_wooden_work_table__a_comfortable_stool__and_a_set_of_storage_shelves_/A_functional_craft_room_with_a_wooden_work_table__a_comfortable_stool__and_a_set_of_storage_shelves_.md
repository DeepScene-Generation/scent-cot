## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a functional craft room designed for crafting activities, storage, and seating, within a square-shaped space measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary focus is on creating an organized layout that supports crafting activities, with a central workspace featuring a wooden work table and adequate lighting. Storage solutions are essential for organizing crafting materials, while comfortable seating is necessary for prolonged crafting sessions. Additional elements such as a task lamp, storage boxes, a pinboard, and a small area rug are suggested to enhance both functionality and aesthetics, with a preference for a rustic and cohesive style.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Central Workspace Area is the core of the room, featuring a wooden work table and lighting for crafting activities. The Storage Area is located along the south wall, designed to efficiently organize and store crafting materials with minimal visual clutter. The Seating Area includes a comfortable stool for ergonomic support during crafting. Additional areas include a Display Area for a pinboard to inspire creativity and a Comfort Area with a rug to add warmth and coziness.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Central Workspace Area, a rustic wooden work table measuring 2.0 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.75 meters is recommended, complemented by a contemporary task lamp for focused lighting. The Storage Area features an industrial-style storage shelf (1.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 2.0 meters) for organizing materials, along with modern plastic storage boxes for additional organization. The Seating Area includes a modern metal and fabric stool (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.6 meters) for comfort. The Display Area is enhanced with a minimalist cork pinboard (0.892 meters by 0.02 meters by 0.604 meters), while the Comfort Area includes a bohemian-style rug (2.0 meters by 2.0 meters) for added warmth.

## 4. Scene Graph
The work table is the focal point of the room, placed centrally to maximize accessibility and functionality. Its rustic style and wooden material align with the user's preference for a central workspace. Positioned in the middle of the room facing the north wall, the table's dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.75m) ensure ample space for movement and future additions, adhering to design principles of balance and proportion.

The stool is strategically placed in front of the work table, facing the south wall, to facilitate comfortable seating and access to the crafting surface. Its modern design and dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.6m) complement the table, ensuring ergonomic support without spatial conflicts, enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic.

The storage shelf is positioned against the east wall, facing the west wall, to maximize floor space and accessibility. Its industrial style and dimensions (1.5m x 0.4m x 2.0m) complement the rustic table and modern stool, creating a cohesive look. This placement allows easy access to crafting materials while maintaining room balance.

The task lamp is placed on the work table, facing the south wall, to provide focused lighting for crafting activities. Its contemporary design and compact dimensions (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) ensure it fits comfortably without interfering with the stool or other objects, enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic.

The storage box is placed on the storage shelf, located on the east wall, to enhance material organization. Its modern style and small dimensions (0.367m x 0.245m x 0.127m) fit comfortably within the shelf, ensuring easy access and visibility, aligning with the user's vision for a functional craft room.

The pinboard is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, ensuring visibility from the work table. Its minimalist style and dimensions (0.892m x 0.02m x 0.604m) fit well with other elements, providing balance and proportion while enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic.

The rug is placed in the middle of the room, underneath the work table and stool, to enhance comfort without interfering with functionality. Its bohemian style and dimensions (2.0m x 2.0m) add aesthetic appeal and warmth, aligning with the user's preference for a comfortable craft room.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose regarding the storage shelf's capacity to accommodate all intended objects, specifically the storage boxes. The shelf's area was insufficient for both storage_box_1 and storage_box_2. To resolve this, storage_box_2 was removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a functional craft room with essential elements like the work table, stool, and storage shelf. This decision maintained the room's functionality and aesthetic balance.
