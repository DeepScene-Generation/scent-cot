## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a contemporary bathroom characterized by a sleek white ceramic sink, a modern bathtub, and a matching white toilet bowl. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, offering ample space for movement. The design emphasizes a minimalist and sleek aesthetic, with a cohesive color scheme and ergonomic functionality. Key areas include the sink area, bathtub area, and toilet area, with a central movement space crucial for comfort and adequate lighting from the ceiling. The user prefers essential objects that enhance both functionality and aesthetics, such as a towel rack, mirror, bath mat, shower caddy, and storage cabinet, while maintaining a minimalist design.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The bathroom is divided into several substructures based on user requirements. The Sink Area is designated for hand washing and grooming, while the Bathtub Area is intended for bathing. The Toilet Area provides essential sanitary functions. The Central Movement Space ensures easy navigation between fixtures and is crucial for user comfort. Additional substructures include the Storage Area for organizing bathroom essentials and the Accessory Area for items like a towel rack and shower caddy, enhancing functionality and maintaining the minimalist aesthetic.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sink Area, a contemporary white ceramic sink is recommended, complemented by a minimalist glass mirror. The Bathtub Area features a modern acrylic bathtub, while the Toilet Area includes a matching white ceramic toilet bowl. A grey minimalist bath mat is suggested for the Central Movement Space, providing comfort and style. The Storage Area benefits from a modern white wood storage cabinet, offering ample space for bathroom essentials. The Accessory Area includes a contemporary silver metal shower caddy for toiletries, enhancing organization and accessibility.

## 4. Scene Graph
The contemporary sink is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, providing a functional and visually appealing location for hand washing. Its dimensions are 0.656 meters in length, 0.491 meters in width, and 0.932 meters in height. This placement allows for plumbing connections and aligns with typical bathroom layouts, ensuring symmetry and ease of use. The bathtub, a large contemporary acrylic piece, is positioned against the east wall, facing the west wall. Measuring 1.7 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.5 meters, it complements the sink and maintains accessibility without obstructing other fixtures. The mirror, with dimensions of 0.8 meters by 0.02 meters by 0.6 meters, is mounted above the sink on the south wall, facing the north wall, providing ample reflection space and enhancing the sink area. The bath mat, measuring 1.0 meters by 0.7 meters, is placed in the central area, in front of the bathtub, ensuring it serves both the sink and toilet areas without obstructing movement. The shower caddy, a contemporary silver metal piece, is mounted on the east wall above the bathtub, measuring 0.313 meters by 0.46 meters by 1.486 meters, providing convenient storage for toiletries. Finally, the storage cabinet, a modern white wood unit measuring 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.5 meters, is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall, offering additional storage without interfering with the bathroom's flow.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the placement of the towel rack, initially intended to be right of the toilet bowl on the south wall, as the sink occupied that space. To resolve this, the towel rack was repositioned to the left of the sink and toilet bowl, maintaining accessibility and coherence with the contemporary design. Additionally, a spatial conflict was identified due to the limited width of the sink, which could not accommodate both the toilet bowl and towel rack. Given the user's preference for a contemporary bathroom with essential fixtures, the towel rack was deemed less critical and was removed to maintain the room's functionality and aesthetic balance.
