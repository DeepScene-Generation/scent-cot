## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user's description outlines a cozy bedroom with a focus on comfort and practicality, emphasizing a harmonious blend of materials to create an inviting atmosphere. The room is designed to feature a plush double bed, a classic wooden nightstand, and a spacious wardrobe, all within a 5.0m x 5.0m x 3.0m space. The user prioritizes a classic style, with the bed as the central feature, complemented by the nightstand and wardrobe for convenience and storage. Additional items such as a lamp, chair, decorative elements, a rug, and a mirror are suggested to complete the room's aesthetic and functional needs.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main areas based on the user's requirements: the Sleeping Area, which centers around the bed for comfort; the Nightstand Area, providing convenience and accessibility; and the Wardrobe Storage Area, offering efficient storage solutions. These areas are designed to align with the user's input, ensuring a balanced and functional layout that supports the room's classic style.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sleeping Area, a plush double bed with dimensions of 2.0m x 1.8m x 0.6m is recommended. The Nightstand Area features a classic wooden nightstand measuring 0.5m x 0.4m x 0.6m, paired with a metal lamp (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.5m) for lighting. The Wardrobe Storage Area includes a spacious wooden wardrobe (1.5m x 0.6m x 2.0m) for ample storage. Additional recommendations include a classic wooden chair (0.6m x 0.6m x 1.0m) for seating, a decorative fabric rug (2.0m x 1.5m) for warmth, a glass mirror (0.5m x 0.05m x 1.5m) for practicality, and a classic-style ceramic decorative item to enhance aesthetics.

## 4. Scene Graph
The bed is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall, as it is the primary object in the room. This placement anchors the bed, optimizing space and allowing for complementary furniture placement on either side. The bed's dimensions (2.0m x 1.8m x 0.6m) fit well against the wall, ensuring no spatial conflicts and aligning with user preferences for a plush double bed.

The nightstand is positioned on the floor, adjacent to the right side of the bed, facing the east wall. This placement ensures easy accessibility and visual cohesion within the bedroom setting. The nightstand's dimensions (0.5m x 0.4m x 0.6m) fit comfortably alongside the bed, maintaining balance and proportion.

The wardrobe is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures no conflicts with existing objects, adhering to user preferences and design principles. The wardrobe's dimensions (1.5m x 0.6m x 2.0m) complement the classic theme of the room and maintain a balanced layout with the bed and nightstand on the west wall.

The lamp is placed on the nightstand, facing the east wall. Its small dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.5m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing the nightstand's functionality or aesthetics. This placement enhances both functionality and aesthetics, providing necessary lighting for the bed area.

The chair is placed in the middle of the room, facing the east wall, slightly towards the west wall. This placement ensures it does not interfere with the bed or wardrobe, allowing for easy movement around the room. The chair's dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 1.0m) maintain the room's classic aesthetic.

The rug is placed on the floor, beneath the chair in the middle of the room. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m) allow it to fit in the available space without encroaching on pathways or other objects, fulfilling both aesthetic and functional requirements.

The mirror is placed on the north wall, adjacent to the wardrobe, with its reflective surface facing the south wall. This placement ensures that the mirror serves its purpose effectively without disrupting the room's design and user preferences. The mirror's dimensions (0.5m x 0.05m x 1.5m) allow it to fit alongside the wardrobe without causing spatial conflict.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the nightstand area being too small to accommodate both the lamp and the decorative item. To resolve this, the decorative item was removed, as the lamp provides essential lighting and aligns more closely with the user's preference for a well-lit bedroom. This decision maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic balance, ensuring the nightstand area remains uncluttered and visually appealing.
