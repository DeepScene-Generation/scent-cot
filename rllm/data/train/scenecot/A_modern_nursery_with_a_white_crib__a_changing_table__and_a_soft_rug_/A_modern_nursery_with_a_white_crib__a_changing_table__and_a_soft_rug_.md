## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a modern nursery that emphasizes safety, convenience, and aesthetics. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key requirements include a white crib, a changing table, and a soft rug, all adhering to a minimalist and modern style. Safety is paramount, with a focus on child-safe materials. The room should also feature a play area, a mobile for visual stimulation, and a rocking chair for parental comfort, all while avoiding clutter to maintain the minimalist aesthetic.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The nursery is divided into three primary substructures: the Crib Area, the Changing Table Area, and the Play Area. The Crib Area is essential for infant sleeping and is designed to be safe and visually appealing. The Changing Table Area is positioned for ergonomic use, ensuring convenience during diaper changes. The Play Area, located centrally, features a soft rug to provide a comfortable and safe space for play. Additional elements like a mobile and a rocking chair enhance the room's functionality and aesthetics.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Crib Area, a modern white crib made of wood is recommended, measuring 1.4 meters by 0.7 meters by 1.0 meter. The Changing Table Area includes a modern white changing table, 1.0 meter by 0.5 meter by 0.9 meter, designed for ergonomic use. The Play Area features a soft grey rug, 2.0 meters by 2.0 meters, made of non-toxic fabric. A multicolor mobile for visual stimulation is suggested above the crib, while a modern silver lamp provides ambient lighting. A pastel blue cushion enhances comfort in the play area, and a rocking chair offers parental seating.

## 4. Scene Graph
The crib is a central element of the nursery, placed against the north wall to save space and allow easy access. Its dimensions (1.4m x 0.7m x 1.0m) fit comfortably, leaving ample space for other items. This placement ensures the crib faces the south wall, providing a sense of openness and allowing caregivers to face the entrance when attending to the infant. The changing table, measuring 1.0m x 0.5m x 0.9m, is placed to the left of the crib on the north wall, maintaining proximity for convenience during diaper changes. This setup ensures balance and symmetry, enhancing functionality and aesthetics.

The rug, 2.0m x 2.0m, is centrally placed on the floor, providing a dedicated play area without obstructing movement. This placement aligns with the user's preference for a soft play area and maintains a balanced layout. The mobile, small in size (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.4m), is hung from the ceiling directly above the crib, ensuring it is within the infant's line of sight for visual stimulation. The lamp, measuring 0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m, is placed on the floor in the middle of the room, providing ambient lighting without cluttering the space. The cushion, 0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m, is placed on the rug, enhancing comfort in the play area.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to insufficient space on the north wall to accommodate all objects, including the crib, changing table, storage unit, and rocking chair. To resolve this, the rocking chair was removed, as it was deemed less critical compared to the crib and changing table, which are essential for the nursery's functionality and align with the user's preference for a modern nursery with a white crib and changing table. This adjustment ensures the room remains functional and visually balanced.
