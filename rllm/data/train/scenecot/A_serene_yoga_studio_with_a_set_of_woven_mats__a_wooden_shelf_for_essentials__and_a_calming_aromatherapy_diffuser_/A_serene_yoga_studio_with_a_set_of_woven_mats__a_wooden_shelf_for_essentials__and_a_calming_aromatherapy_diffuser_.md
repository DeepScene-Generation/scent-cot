## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a serene yoga studio that emphasizes functionality and a calming ambiance. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, is intended to accommodate areas for yoga mats, a wooden shelf for essentials, and an aromatherapy diffuser. The user desires a minimalist style with woven yoga mats as the central focus, complemented by a wooden shelf to store yoga essentials like blocks and straps. An aromatherapy diffuser is essential for enhancing the calming atmosphere, and additional elements like a small seating area with meditation cushions and ambient lighting are considered to optimize the space without cluttering it.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The central area is designated for yoga mats, providing ample space for yoga poses and movements. A Storage Area is identified along the south wall for a wooden shelf to organize yoga essentials. The Aromatherapy Area is also along the south wall, where the diffuser will enhance the room's ambiance. Additionally, a Lighting Area is established along the west wall to provide ambient lighting, and a potential Seating Area is considered for meditation cushions to facilitate relaxation.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central Yoga Mat Area, a set of minimalist woven yoga mats, each measuring 1.8 meters by 0.6 meters, is recommended to accommodate multiple users. The Storage Area will feature a minimalist wooden shelf (1.2 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.5 meters) to store yoga essentials. The Aromatherapy Area includes a modern ceramic aromatherapy diffuser (0.237 meters by 0.244 meters by 0.303 meters) to enhance the calming atmosphere. The Lighting Area will have a modern metal floor lamp (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.5 meters) for ambient lighting, and a modern plastic LED candle (0.1 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.15 meters) will complement the lighting setup.

## 4. Scene Graph
The first yoga mat is placed centrally in the room, 2.5 meters from both the north and south walls, to create a focal point for practice. Its dimensions (1.8m x 0.6m x 0.02m) allow it to fit comfortably in the middle, ensuring balance and symmetry, which enhances the minimalist style and functionality of the space. The second yoga mat is positioned adjacent to the first, maintaining the openness and tranquility of the studio. This placement ensures easy access and a cohesive layout, with dimensions identical to the first mat.

The wooden shelf is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to provide stability and easy access to stored items. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.4m x 1.5m) allow it to fit comfortably without disrupting the yoga practice area. The aromatherapy diffuser is placed on top of the wooden shelf, facing the north wall, to disperse scent effectively throughout the room. Its small size ensures it fits comfortably on the shelf without spatial conflicts.

The floor lamp is positioned against the west wall, facing the east wall, to provide optimal ambient lighting without obstructing the flow of yoga practice. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.5m) ensure it complements the minimalist style and provides sufficient lighting. The LED candle is placed on the wooden shelf, facing the north wall, to enhance ambient lighting without taking up additional floor space. Its small size (0.1m x 0.1m x 0.15m) allows it to fit comfortably alongside the diffuser.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to limited space on the wooden shelf and in the middle of the room. The shelf was too small to accommodate all intended objects, leading to the removal of the projector and two LED candles to prioritize the aromatherapy diffuser and maintain the room's serene ambiance. In the central area, the space was insufficient for all yoga mats and meditation cushions, resulting in the removal of one yoga mat and both meditation cushions to preserve the user's preference for a set of woven mats and a calming environment.
