## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a music practice room that prioritizes acoustics and functionality, featuring a classic black piano, a wooden music stand, and a comfortable bench. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, which is noted for its acoustic benefits. The design emphasizes a simple, uncluttered aesthetic, with additional elements like an acoustic panel and a small side table to enhance functionality and ambiance without overwhelming the space.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures. The Piano Area is the focal point, housing the piano, bench, and music stand for music practice. The Acoustic Enhancement Area includes an acoustic panel to improve sound quality. The Accessory Area features a side table for storing music-related items, while the Lighting Area ensures adequate illumination for practice. The Rug Area unifies the music practice space and enhances acoustics.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Piano Area, a classic black piano (1.5m x 0.6m x 1.2m), a wooden music stand (0.5m x 0.4m x 1.2m), and a modern wooden bench (1.0m x 0.4m x 0.5m) are recommended. The Acoustic Enhancement Area includes a modern fabric acoustic panel (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.5m). The Accessory Area features a modern wooden side table (0.6m x 0.4m x 0.5m) and a classic wooden metronome (0.1m x 0.1m x 0.2m). The Lighting Area includes a modern silver metal lamp (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m). Finally, the Rug Area features a minimalist wool rug (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.01m) to enhance acoustics.

## 4. Scene Graph
The piano, a central element of the room, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement maximizes space and allows sound to project effectively into the room, aligning with user preferences and design principles. The piano's dimensions (1.5m x 0.6m x 1.2m) fit comfortably against the wall, ensuring it remains the room's focal point.

The music stand is positioned to the right of the piano, also facing the north wall. This placement ensures easy access to sheet music for the pianist, maintaining a comfortable space for movement. The music stand's dimensions (0.5m x 0.4m x 1.2m) allow it to fit without overlapping other objects, supporting the room's functionality and aesthetic.

The bench is placed directly in front of the piano, facing the north wall. This positioning allows for comfortable seating during practice, with the bench's dimensions (1.0m x 0.4m x 0.5m) fitting well in the available space. The bench's placement maintains balance and proportion in the room, adhering to design principles.

The acoustic panel is mounted on the north wall, facing the south wall. This strategic placement enhances sound absorption from the piano, improving the room's acoustics. The panel's dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.5m) ensure it does not obstruct other elements, maintaining the room's aesthetic and functional balance.

The side table is placed on the south wall, to the left of the piano, facing the north wall. This location provides easy access to accessories, with the table's dimensions (0.6m x 0.4m x 0.5m) fitting comfortably in the space. The table complements the room's layout, enhancing functionality without cluttering the area.

The metronome is placed on the music stand, ensuring it is within easy reach for tempo guidance during practice. Its small size (0.1m x 0.1m x 0.2m) ensures it does not interfere with other objects, maintaining the room's organized appearance.

The music sheets are also placed on the music stand, ensuring they are easily accessible during practice. Their small size (0.3m x 0.2m x 0.05m) allows them to fit without obstructing the metronome or other items, supporting the room's functionality and aesthetic.

The lamp is placed on the side table, left of the piano, facing the north wall. This placement provides balanced lighting for the piano area, with the lamp's dimensions (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) fitting well on the table. The lamp enhances the room's functionality and modern aesthetic.

The rug is placed under both the piano and bench, centralizing the music practice area. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.01m) allow it to fit without obstructing other objects, enhancing acoustics and comfort in the practice space.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects fit within the room's dimensions and layout, maintaining the user's vision for a functional and aesthetically pleasing music practice room.

                - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.15-4.85), y(0.1-0.1)
                - Final coordinates: x=4.1406, y=0.1, z=1.225
            - conclusion: Final position: x: 4.1406, y: 0.1, z: 1.225
        5. reason: Collision check with other objects
            - calculation:
                - No collision detected with other objects
            - conclusion: No collision detected
        6. reason: Final position calculation
            - calculation:
                - Final coordinates: x=4.1406, y=0.1, z=1.225
            - conclusion: Final position: x: 4.1406, y: 0.1, z: 1.225

For acoustic_panel_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No other objects to calculate rotation difference
        - conclusion: No rotation difference calculation needed
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'on' relation
        - calculation:
            - acoustic_panel_1 size: 1.0 (length)
            - Cluster size (on): max(0.0, 1.0) = 1.0
        - conclusion: acoustic_panel_1 cluster size (on): 1.0
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'north_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - acoustic_panel_1 size: length=1.0, width=0.05, height=1.5
            - x_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 1.0/2 = 0.5
            - x_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 1.0/2 = 4.5
            - y_min = y_max = 4.975
            - z_min = z_max = 0.75
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.5, 4.5, 4.975, 4.975, 0.75, 0.75)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.5-4.5), y(4.975-4.975)
            - Final coordinates: x=0.7646, y=4.975, z=1.7908
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.7646, y: 4.975, z: 1.7908
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Final coordinates: x=0.7646, y=4.975, z=1.7908
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.7646, y: 4.975, z: 1.7908
