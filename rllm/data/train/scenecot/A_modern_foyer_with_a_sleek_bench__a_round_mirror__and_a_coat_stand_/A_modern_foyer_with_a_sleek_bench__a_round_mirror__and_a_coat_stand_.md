## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a modern foyer that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user has specified a preference for a sleek bench, a round mirror, and a coat stand, emphasizing a contemporary and welcoming aesthetic. Functional needs include seating for changing shoes, a mirror for light reflection and appearance checking, and a coat stand for outerwear. Additional suggestions include a console table for keys and mail, a small rug to define the space, and a decorative plant to add a touch of nature. The overall design should maintain an open and functional space, with each object contributing to both practical needs and the modern aesthetic.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The foyer is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The first substructure is the Seating Area, featuring a sleek bench for shoe changing. The second is the Entryway Storage Area, which includes a coat stand for outerwear. The third is the Reflective Area, where a round mirror is placed to reflect light and allow for appearance checking. Additional substructures include the Storage and Display Area, with a console table for keys and mail, and the Decorative Area, featuring a small rug to define the space and a decorative plant to enhance the aesthetic.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a modern-style bench made of wood, measuring 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.45 meters, is recommended. The Entryway Storage Area includes a modern metal coat stand, 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.8 meters, for holding coats and hats. In the Reflective Area, a round modern mirror made of glass, 0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.02 meters, is suggested. The Storage and Display Area features a modern wood console table, 1.2 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.8 meters, for holding keys and mail. The Decorative Area includes a modern fabric rug, 1.8 meters by 1.2 meters, to define the space, and a decorative plant in a ceramic pot, 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meters, to add greenery.

## 4. Scene Graph
The bench is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, as it provides easy seating without obstructing the room's flow. Its sleek, modern design and black color make it a visually appealing addition to the foyer. The bench's placement against the wall ensures balance and proportion, aligning with the user's preference for a modern aesthetic while maintaining functionality.

The coat stand is positioned on the east wall, facing the west wall, to the right of the entrance. This placement allows easy access for hanging coats and hats without disrupting the room's flow. The coat stand's modest size ensures it does not overwhelm the space, and its silver color complements the modern style of the room.

The mirror is mounted on the north wall, facing the south wall, serving as a central feature in the room. This placement allows the mirror to reflect light from the south-facing entryway, enhancing the room's brightness. The mirror's location ensures it is easily accessible and visible, fulfilling its functional purpose while complementing the modern aesthetic.

The console table is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, centrally located to provide balance and accessibility. Its white color and sleek design align with the modern style of the room. The console table serves as a functional surface for holding keys and mail, enhancing the room's usability.

The rug is placed in the middle of the room, serving as a central piece that enhances the spatial definition and cohesion of the foyer. Its gray color and modern style align with the user's vision of a modern foyer, providing a cohesive element that connects the furniture without obstructing any paths.

The decorative plant is placed on the floor to the right of the console table on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement adds greenery to the space without blocking pathways, enhancing the aesthetic appeal and maintaining the room's modern and functional design.

## 5. Global Check
