## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user aims to create a functional home office that includes essential furniture such as a work table, an ergonomic office chair, and a filing cabinet. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary focus is on efficiency, comfort, and organization, with a preference for a professional and uncluttered ambiance. The user also desires a cohesive visual alignment of furniture, calming colors, and a ceiling lighting system to adjust brightness according to tasks. Additional items like a desk lamp, rug, and plant are included to enhance the workspace's aesthetic and comfort.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key areas based on the user's requirements. The central workspace is designated for the work table, ensuring ample space for various tasks. The seating area is positioned in front of the work table for ergonomic seating. The storage area is along the south wall for the filing cabinet, providing easy access to documents. The ceiling is reserved for the lighting system to ensure optimal illumination. Additional areas include a corner for the plant to enhance ambiance and a central floor space for the rug to tie the room together aesthetically.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central workspace, a contemporary-style work table made of wood, measuring 1.8 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.72 meters, is recommended. An ergonomic office chair with dimensions of 0.663 meters by 0.683 meters by 0.986 meters is suggested for comfortable seating. A modern metal filing cabinet, 0.8 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.2 meters, is proposed for document storage. The ceiling will feature an adjustable metal light fixture to provide general lighting. A modern silver desk lamp, measuring 0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.4 meters, is recommended for focused lighting on the work table. A contemporary wool rug, 2.5 meters by 2.5 meters, will add aesthetic appeal and comfort. Lastly, a minimalist plant in a ceramic pot, measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meters, will enhance the room's ambiance.

## 4. Scene Graph
The work table is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, to allow for ergonomic seating and focus. Its dimensions (1.8m x 0.9m x 0.72m) fit comfortably without overcrowding the room, and its walnut color complements the room's aesthetic. This placement ensures easy access and efficient use of space, aligning with the user's preference for a functional home office.

The office chair is positioned in front of the work table, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.663m x 0.683m x 0.986m) allow it to fit well without obstructing movement. This placement ensures ergonomic seating and effective task management, complementing the walnut table with its black color.

The filing cabinet is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.4m x 1.2m) fit along the wall without conflicting with other objects. This placement allows easy access from the work table, supporting organization and functionality while maintaining balance and utilizing vertical space.

The ceiling light is centrally located on the ceiling to provide optimal lighting for the entire room. Its dimensions (0.447m x 0.441m x 0.876m) ensure it does not conflict with floor-based objects. This placement enhances functionality and provides an aesthetically pleasing ambiance.

The desk lamp is placed on the work table, towards a corner, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.4m) ensure it does not interfere with the user's workspace. This placement provides focused lighting while maintaining functionality and aesthetics.

The rug is centrally placed under the work table and office chair, with dimensions (2.5m x 2.5m x 0.01m). This placement offers comfort and aesthetic cohesion, complementing the existing furniture and enhancing the room's contemporary feel.

The plant is placed in the south-east corner of the room, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) ensure it does not obstruct movement. This placement enhances the ambiance without disrupting the workflow, adding a natural element to the room.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed without spatial conflicts, adhering to the user's preferences and design principles. The room maintains a functional and organized layout, with each object contributing to the overall aesthetic and functionality of the home office.
