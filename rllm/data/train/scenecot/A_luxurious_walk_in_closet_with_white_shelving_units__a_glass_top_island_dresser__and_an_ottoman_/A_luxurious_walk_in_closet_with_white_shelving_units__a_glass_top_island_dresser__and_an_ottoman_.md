## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a luxurious walk-in closet that emphasizes elegance and functionality. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include white shelving units, a glass-top island dresser, and an ottoman, all contributing to a high-end aesthetic. The user desires a space that is both organized and visually appealing, with additional features like overhead lighting, a full-length mirror, and a jewelry organizer to enhance functionality and style.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The South Wall Area is designated for shelving units to maximize storage and maintain a luxurious look. The Central Area is reserved for the glass-top island dresser, serving as the room's focal point. The Middle Area also accommodates the ottoman for seating. The Ceiling Area is utilized for overhead lighting to ensure even illumination. The East Wall Area is allocated for the full-length mirror, providing a space for outfit selection. Lastly, the island dresser's top surface is used for the jewelry organizer, enhancing the room's functionality.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the South Wall Area, four white shelving units are recommended, each measuring 1.2 meters by 0.3 meters by 2.5 meters, to organize clothing and accessories. The Central Area features a glass-top island dresser (1.5 meters by 1.0 meters by 0.9 meters) for displaying jewelry. An ottoman (0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters) is suggested for the Middle Area to provide seating. The Ceiling Area includes a modern silver overhead light (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters) for illumination. A full-length mirror (0.6 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.8 meters) is recommended for the East Wall Area to facilitate outfit selection. Finally, a jewelry organizer (0.4 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.2 meters) is proposed for the island dresser's top surface.

## 4. Scene Graph
The first shelving unit is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to organize clothing efficiently. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.3m x 2.5m) allow it to fit snugly against the wall, maximizing floor space and maintaining stability. This placement aligns with the user's preference for a luxurious and organized space, ensuring the room remains open and elegant.

The second shelving unit is also placed on the south wall, adjacent to the first unit, to create a continuous storage area. This arrangement enhances visual balance and maximizes storage space, adhering to the user's luxurious design preference. The unit's dimensions (1.2m x 0.3m x 2.5m) fit comfortably within the wall space, ensuring no spatial conflicts.

The glass-top island dresser is centrally placed in the room, serving as the focal point. Its dimensions (1.5m x 1.0m x 0.9m) allow it to be accessible from all sides, enhancing functionality and visibility. This central placement ensures the dresser complements the shelving units without interference, maintaining a luxurious aesthetic.

The ottoman is positioned adjacent to the island dresser, facing the south wall. Its small size (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.4m) allows for flexible placement, providing seating without obstructing pathways. This placement enhances the room's functionality and luxurious feel, aligning with user preferences.

The overhead light is centrally mounted on the ceiling, directly above the island dresser. This placement ensures even lighting distribution throughout the room, enhancing the luxurious ambiance. The light's modern style and silver color complement the room's aesthetic, avoiding conflicts with other objects.

The full-length mirror is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.05m x 1.8m) allow it to fit against the wall without interference, providing a stable and accessible space for outfit selection. This placement enhances the room's functionality and maintains a luxurious theme.

The jewelry organizer is placed on top of the island dresser, facing the north wall. Its compact size (0.4m x 0.3m x 0.2m) fits well on the dresser's surface, enhancing its functionality by providing a dedicated space for jewelry. This placement aligns with the user's vision for a luxurious and organized closet.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to insufficient space on the south wall to accommodate all four shelving units. To resolve this, shelving units 3 and 4 were removed, as they were deemed less critical to the user's preference for a luxurious walk-in closet with a focus on the island dresser and ottoman. This adjustment ensures the room remains functional and visually appealing, adhering to the user's design preferences.
