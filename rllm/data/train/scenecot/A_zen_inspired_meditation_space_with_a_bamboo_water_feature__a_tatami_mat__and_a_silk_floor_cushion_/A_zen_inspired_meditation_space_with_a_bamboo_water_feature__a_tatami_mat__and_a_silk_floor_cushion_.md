## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a zen-inspired meditation space that emphasizes tranquility, minimalism, and the use of natural materials. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements requested by the user include a bamboo water feature, a tatami mat, and a silk floor cushion. The user desires a space that is not overcrowded, maintaining a balance between functionality and aesthetics, with a preference for natural and minimalist design elements.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The 'Tatami Mat Area' serves as the central meditation zone, focusing on tranquility and minimalism with natural materials. The 'Silk Floor Cushion' substructure provides comfortable seating for meditation, complementing the tatami mat. The 'Bamboo Water Feature' substructure enhances the room's auditory and visual tranquility, requiring a stable placement. Additional elements like a bonsai plant and a low wooden table are considered to enhance the zen atmosphere, providing visual interest and functional benefits while maintaining the room's minimalist aesthetic.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the 'Tatami Mat Area,' a zen-style tatami mat measuring 2.0 meters by 2.0 meters is recommended as the central element. The 'Silk Floor Cushion,' with dimensions of 0.6 meters by 0.6 meters, is suggested to provide comfortable seating on the tatami mat. The 'Bamboo Water Feature,' measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter, is recommended to enhance tranquility. A bonsai plant, with dimensions of 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.5 meters, is proposed to contribute to the natural aesthetic. A low wooden table was initially considered to provide functionality but was later removed due to spatial conflicts.

## 4. Scene Graph
The tatami mat is placed centrally in the room, serving as the focal point for meditation activities. Its dimensions (2.0m x 2.0m x 0.05m) are suitable for the room size, allowing ample space around it for movement and additional objects. This central placement aligns with the user's vision of a zen meditation area, ensuring balance and proportion while maintaining functionality as a dedicated meditation space.

The silk floor cushion is placed on the tatami mat, providing seating for meditation. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.15m) allow it to fit comfortably on the mat, maintaining the zen aesthetic and ensuring functionality. This placement adheres to traditional zen design practices, keeping the central area dedicated to meditation.

The bamboo water feature is positioned against the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) allow it to fit easily without overwhelming the space. This placement ensures the water feature enhances auditory and visual tranquility, with the sound reaching the central meditation area. The south wall provides stability and a suitable backdrop, preserving the minimalist aesthetic.

The bonsai plant is placed on the tatami mat, adjacent to the silk floor cushion. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.5m) make it a subtle focal point, enhancing the zen-inspired aesthetic without overwhelming the room's simplicity. This placement promotes focus and harmony, aligning with the user's preference for natural elements.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to the limited space on the tatami mat, which could not accommodate all intended objects. Specifically, the low wooden table and soft rug were identified as conflicting with the existing elements. To resolve these conflicts, the low wooden table and soft rug were removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a zen-inspired meditation space with a bamboo water feature, tatami mat, and silk floor cushion. This decision maintained the room's functionality and aesthetic, ensuring a balanced and serene environment.
