## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires an elegant tea room designed to foster a serene and sophisticated atmosphere. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, is intended for hosting tea gatherings. Key elements include a glass-top tea table, upholstered chairs, and a sideboard for teaware. The user emphasizes the need for comfortable seating and easy access to teaware, with a preference for an elegant style that incorporates additional decorative elements such as a rug, tea set, wall art, and plants to enhance the room's aesthetic.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The central Seating Area is designed for social interaction, featuring a glass-top tea table and upholstered chairs. The Storage and Display Area, located along the south wall, houses a sideboard for teaware. The Lighting Area is centered on the ceiling to provide ambient illumination. Additional decorative elements, such as a rug, wall art, and plants, are strategically placed to enhance the room's elegance and create a cohesive aesthetic.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a modern glass-top tea table (1.2m x 1.2m x 0.4m) and four upholstered chairs (each 0.7m x 0.535m x 0.801m) are recommended to facilitate tea gatherings. The Storage and Display Area features a wooden sideboard (1.8m x 0.5m x 0.9m) for teaware. A ceiling light (0.161m x 0.161m x 0.776m) is suggested for the Lighting Area to ensure adequate illumination. Additional decorative elements include a cream-colored wool rug (2.0m x 2.0m), a porcelain tea set, multicolor canvas wall art (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.0m), and a ceramic decorative plant (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.0m) to enhance the room's elegance.

## 4. Scene Graph
The glass-top tea table is placed centrally in the room, serving as the focal point for tea gatherings. Its transparent design ensures it does not visually overwhelm the space, and its central placement allows for easy access from all sides, facilitating interaction and movement. The table faces the north wall, aligning with the room's elegant aesthetic and functional goals.

The first upholstered chair is positioned to the south of the tea table, facing the north wall. This placement ensures easy access and maintains an intimate setting around the table, complementing the elegant style desired by the user. The second upholstered chair is placed opposite the first, behind the tea table, also facing the north wall. This symmetrical arrangement enhances the room's aesthetic appeal and functionality for tea gatherings.

The third upholstered chair is placed to the left of the tea table, facing the east wall. This placement complements the existing setup, enhancing the room's elegance and maintaining balance around the table. The fourth chair is positioned to the right of the tea table, facing the west wall, completing a balanced seating arrangement that supports the room's elegant theme.

The sideboard is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This location provides a functional storage solution for teaware while enhancing the room's elegance. The sideboard's placement ensures clear walkways and an uncluttered look, maintaining the room's visual harmony.

The ceiling light is centrally placed, suspended from the ceiling, providing balanced illumination to the tea table and chairs. Its gold color and elegant design contribute to the room's theme, ensuring the space is well-lit and aesthetically pleasing.

The decorative rug is placed under the tea table, covering the space beneath the table and chairs. This placement enhances the room's elegance and creates a unified, inviting seating area. The rug's cream color complements the beige chairs and transparent table, maintaining the room's elegant theme.

The tea set is placed on the sideboard, allowing easy access for serving and displaying, thus enhancing both functionality and aesthetics. This placement aligns with the user's preference for an elegant tea room setup.

The wall art is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. This location ensures the art is visible from the seating area, enhancing the room's elegance without interfering with other objects. The placement provides balance and adds a focal point to the room.

The decorative plant is placed on the south wall, adjacent to the sideboard, facing the north wall. This placement complements the existing furniture setup and enhances the room's elegance by adding a natural element without obstructing movement or function.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed in a manner that respects the room's dimensions and the user's preferences for an elegant tea room. The arrangement maintains balance and functionality, ensuring a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing environment.
