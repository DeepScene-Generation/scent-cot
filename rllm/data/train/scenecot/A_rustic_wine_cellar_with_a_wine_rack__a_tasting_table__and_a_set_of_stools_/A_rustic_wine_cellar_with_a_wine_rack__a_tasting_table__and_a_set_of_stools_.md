## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a rustic wine cellar that includes a wine rack, a tasting table, and a set of stools. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for these elements. The rustic style emphasizes the use of natural materials like wood and stone to create a cohesive aesthetic. The user desires a functional space that allows for wine storage and tasting, with additional elements such as ambient lighting, a sideboard for serving accessories, and wall-mounted wine glass holders to enhance the room's utility and atmosphere. The total number of objects should not exceed 13, necessitating careful selection of multifunctional items.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Wine Storage Area is designated for the wine rack, ensuring easy access and prominence. The Tasting Area is centered around the tasting table, designed for social interaction and wine tasting sessions. The Seating Area surrounds the tasting table with stools to accommodate guests. The Serving Area includes a sideboard for serving accessories, while the Lighting Area focuses on ambient lighting to enhance the rustic atmosphere. Lastly, the Accessory Area features a wine glass holder to keep wine-related items organized and accessible.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Wine Storage Area, a large wooden wine rack is recommended to store a variety of wine bottles securely. The Tasting Area features a robust wooden table with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.0 meter, complemented by a set of four rustic-style stools, each measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters, to provide comfortable seating. The Serving Area includes a wooden sideboard measuring 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters for additional storage and serving space. The Lighting Area is enhanced with a bronze ambient light fixture, while the Accessory Area includes a metal wine glass holder to maintain organization and accessibility.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wine rack is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement is ideal for accessibility and aesthetic appeal, making it a central and functional piece in the rustic wine cellar. The wine rack's dimensions are 4.5 meters in length, 0.3 meters in width, and 2.5 meters in height, allowing it to store a variety of wine bottles securely while enhancing the room's rustic charm.

The tasting table is placed in the middle of the room, facing the north wall, enhancing the rustic wine cellar theme and maintaining harmony with the existing wine rack. The table's dimensions are 2.0 meters in length, 1.0 meter in width, and 0.8 meters in height, making it a central feature that encourages social interaction and provides easy access to the wine rack for convenient wine selection.

Stool 1 is placed in front of the tasting table, facing the north wall. This positioning maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic, offering an ideal seating arrangement for wine tasting. The stool's dimensions are 0.5 meters in length, 0.5 meters in width, and 1.0 meter in height, ensuring ample space around the tasting table without causing spatial conflicts.

Stool 2 is placed behind the tasting table, facing the north wall. This placement creates a balanced and functional seating arrangement around the table, enhancing the rustic aesthetic by creating a symmetrical look. The stool's dimensions are 0.5 meters in length, 0.5 meters in width, and 1.0 meter in height, allowing it to fit comfortably without crowding the area.

Stool 3 is placed to the left of the tasting table, facing the east wall. It is adjacent to the table, ensuring ease of access for seating during wine tasting sessions. The stool's dimensions are 0.5 meters in length, 0.5 meters in width, and 1.0 meter in height, fitting comfortably to the side of the table without obstructing movement.

Stool 4 is placed to the right of the tasting table, facing the west wall. This maintains symmetry and balance around the table, is functionally appropriate, and aligns with the rustic aesthetic. The stool's dimensions are 0.5 meters in length, 0.5 meters in width, and 1.0 meter in height, ensuring no interference with other objects.

The sideboard is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement enhances the room's functionality for serving and storage while maintaining a clear central area for wine tasting activities. The sideboard's dimensions are 1.5 meters in length, 0.5 meters in width, and 1.0 meter in height, fitting comfortably along the wall without conflicting with existing objects.

The ambient light is placed on the ceiling in the middle of the room, providing overhead lighting to the central tasting area. This placement ensures that the light evenly illuminates the tasting table and surrounding stools, enhancing both functionality and ambiance. The light fixture's dimensions are 0.3 meters in length, 0.3 meters in width, and 0.3 meters in height, ensuring it does not interfere with any floor-standing objects.

The wine glass holder is placed above the wine rack on the north wall, oriented facing the south wall. This placement maintains the room's rustic theme and enhances its functionality as a wine cellar. The holder's dimensions are 0.8 meters in length, 0.3 meters in width, and 0.2 meters in height, allowing it to fit above the wine rack without consuming much space.

## 5. Global Check
There were no conflicts identified during the placement process. The arrangement of objects within the room adheres to the user's preferences and design principles, ensuring a functional and aesthetically pleasing rustic wine cellar. Each object is placed to maximize utility and maintain a cohesive look, with no need for repositioning or deletion of objects.

For ambient_light_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No child objects to compare
        - conclusion: No rotation difference calculation needed
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'ceiling' relation
        - calculation:
            - ambient_light_1 size: length=0.3, width=0.3
            - Cluster size (ceiling): 0.0 (non-directional)
        - conclusion: No directional constraint applied
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'ceiling' constraint
        - calculation:
            - Room size: 5.0x5.0x3.0
            - x_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 0.3/2 = 0.15
