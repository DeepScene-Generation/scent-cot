## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a contemporary living room characterized by a sleek and modern aesthetic. The primary elements include a gray fabric sofa, a wooden coffee table with a glass top, and a black metal floor lamp. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes comfort and functionality, with additional suggestions for a rug, decorative cushions, and wall art to enhance texture and color while maintaining a cohesive design. The focus is on optimizing the layout with essential furniture and decor items, avoiding elements related to doors or windows.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The living room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Sofa Area is designated for comfortable seating with a contemporary gray sofa. The Coffee Table Area serves as a central piece providing surface space for drinks and decor. The Floor Lamp Area is essential for providing adequate lighting and ambiance. Additional substructures include the Rug Area, which adds texture and color, and the Decorative Area, which includes cushions and wall art to enhance the room's aesthetic appeal.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sofa Area, a contemporary gray fabric sofa is recommended for its comfort and modern style. The Coffee Table Area features a wooden table with a glass top, complementing the sofa and maintaining visual harmony. A black metal floor lamp is suggested for the Floor Lamp Area to provide warm illumination and fit the modern style. A beige wool rug is recommended for the Rug Area to add texture and color contrast. Decorative cushions in blue and yellow are proposed to enhance the sofa's aesthetic, while multicolor wall art is suggested to serve as a focal point above the sofa.

## 4. Scene Graph
The contemporary gray sofa is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures proper space utilization and keeps the room balanced, aligning with the user's desire for a contemporary setup. The sofa's dimensions are 2.5 meters in length, 1.0 meter in width, and 0.8 meters in height. Placing the sofa against the north wall provides balance, leaving space in front for the coffee table and maintaining an open layout.

The wooden coffee table with a glass top is positioned directly in front of the sofa, in the middle of the room. This placement ensures ease of access and maintains the functional relationship between the sofa and the coffee table. The coffee table's dimensions are 1.2 meters in length, 0.6 meters in width, and 0.4 meters in height, fitting comfortably without obstructing walkways.

The black metal floor lamp is placed to the right of the sofa, adjacent to it, providing optimal lighting to the seating area while maintaining a balanced aesthetic. The lamp's dimensions are 0.4 meters in length, 0.4 meters in width, and 1.8 meters in height. This placement ensures it does not obstruct the view or traffic flow, enhancing the modern aesthetic of the space.

The beige wool rug is placed centrally in the living room, directly under the coffee table. The rug's dimensions are 2.0 meters in length, 1.5 meters in width, and 0.02 meters in height. This placement enhances the room's balance and symmetry, providing a soft surface underfoot around the coffee table area without spatial conflict with the existing sofa and floor lamp.

The blue cushion is placed centrally on the sofa, providing a pop of color and additional comfort. Its dimensions are 0.5 meters in length, 0.5 meters in width, and 0.15 meters in height. The cushion's placement ensures it is visually balanced and does not impede the use of the sofa, aligning with contemporary design principles.

The yellow cushion is placed on the sofa opposite the blue cushion, ensuring a balanced and visually appealing arrangement. Its dimensions are 0.5 meters in length, 0.5 meters in width, and 0.15 meters in height. This placement complements the existing decor by introducing a pop of color, enhancing the contemporary style.

The multicolor wall art is placed on the north wall above the sofa, serving as a focal point in the room. Its dimensions are 1.0 meter in length, 0.05 meters in width, and 0.7 meters in height. This placement ensures the art is visible and enhances the contemporary look without overcrowding the space, aligning with the user's input for a cohesive living room setup.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The arrangement of objects in the room adheres to the user's preferences and design principles, ensuring a contemporary and functional living space. All elements work together harmoniously, maintaining balance and proportion without spatial conflicts.
