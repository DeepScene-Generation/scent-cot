## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a rustic dining room centered around a wooden dining table, complemented by a bench seat and a ceramic vase centerpiece. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user has not specified additional furniture or decor, but the emphasis is on a rustic aesthetic, suggesting a preference for natural materials like reclaimed wood and oak. The primary functional requirement is to create a dining area that is both aesthetically pleasing and practical for seating and gathering.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three key substructures: the Dining Table Area, the Centerpiece Display, and the Movement Space. The Dining Table Area is the focal point, designed for seating and social interaction. The Centerpiece Display enhances the room's aesthetic with a ceramic vase and wildflowers, while the Movement Space ensures accessibility and safety around the dining setup. These substructures collectively support the room's rustic theme and functional needs.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Dining Table Area, a rustic wooden dining table and a bench seat are recommended, both crafted from reclaimed wood and oak to align with the rustic theme. Additional seating is provided by two oak dining chairs. The Centerpiece Display features a ceramic vase with wildflowers, adding a natural touch to the table. To further enhance the rustic ambiance, a wool rug in earth tones defines the dining area, and a rustic chandelier provides lighting. A sideboard made of reclaimed wood offers storage against the east wall.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dining table, crafted from reclaimed wood, is the central piece of the room, placed slightly off-center towards the north wall to create an intimate dining atmosphere. Its dimensions are 2.0 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.75 meters, allowing ample space for movement and additional seating. The table faces the north wall, aligning with the rustic theme and providing a clear view for diners. The bench seat, made of oak wood, is positioned adjacent to the south side of the dining table, facing the north wall. Its dimensions are 2.0 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.45 meters, matching the table's length for a seamless aesthetic fit.

A rustic dining chair, measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.9 meters, is placed to the right of the dining table, facing the west wall. This placement maintains symmetry and provides additional seating. Another dining chair of the same dimensions is placed to the left of the table, facing the east wall, ensuring balanced seating. The ceramic vase, with dimensions of 0.13 meters by 0.13 meters by 0.119 meters, serves as a decorative centerpiece on the dining table, centrally placed to enhance the table's aesthetic appeal.

The wool rug, measuring 2.5 meters by 2.5 meters, is placed under the dining table, extending to cover the area where the bench and chairs are situated. This placement defines the dining area without overwhelming the space. The rustic chandelier, with dimensions of 0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.5 meters, is suspended from the ceiling directly above the dining table, providing balanced lighting and complementing the rustic decor. Finally, the sideboard, measuring 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.8 meters, is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement maximizes space and functionality, offering storage without disrupting the room's flow.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the placement of the wildflowers, as the ceramic vase's width was too small to accommodate them to its left. To resolve this, the wildflowers were removed, prioritizing the ceramic vase as the centerpiece, which aligns with the user's preference for a rustic dining room with a wooden dining table and a ceramic vase centerpiece. This adjustment ensures the room's functionality and aesthetic coherence are maintained.

For sideboard_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with other objects
        - calculation:
            - Rotation of sideboard_1: 270.0°
            - No other objects with rotation constraints
        - conclusion: No directional constraint applied
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'east_wall' relation
        - calculation:
            - sideboard_1 size: 1.5x0.5x0.8
            - Cluster size (east_wall): 0.0 (non-directional)
        - conclusion: No directional constraint applied
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'east_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - x_min = 5.0 + -1 * 0.0/2 + -1 * 0.5/2 = 4.75
            - x_max = 5.0 + -1 * 0.0/2 + -1 * 0.5/2 = 4.75
            - y_min = 2.5 + -1 * 5.0/2 + 1 * 1.5/2 = 0.75
            - y_max = 2.5 + 1 * 5.0/2 + -1 * 1.5/2 = 4.25
            - z_min = z_max = 0.8/2 = 0.4
        - conclusion: Possible position: (4.75, 4.75, 0.75, 4.25, 0.4, 0.4)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(4.75-4.75), y(0.75-4.25)
            - Final coordinates: x=4.75, y=4.029535156289466, z=0.4
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 4.75, y: 4.029535156289466, z: 0.4
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
