## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a minimalist living room characterized by simplicity and openness, focusing on essential elements such as a white sofa, a black geometric rug, and a wooden TV stand. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user's preference for a minimalist aesthetic emphasizes functionality and aesthetics, with a desire for a low-profile white sofa, a simple wooden TV stand, and a black geometric rug. Additional elements like a coffee table, side tables, a floor lamp, and decorative cushions are considered to enhance functionality while maintaining the minimalist theme.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key areas based on the user's requirements. The Sofa Area is positioned against the south wall, providing comfortable seating aligned with the minimalist design. The TV Stand Area is centered on the north wall, ensuring ergonomic viewing angles from the sofa. The Rug Area is placed centrally in front of the sofa to enhance visual interest and maintain open space for movement. Additional areas include the Coffee Table Area, positioned on the rug to enhance functionality, and the Side Table Areas, flanking the sofa to provide convenient surfaces for items. The Lighting Area is defined by the placement of a floor lamp to provide ambient lighting, and the Decor Area includes cushions on the sofa to enhance comfort and aesthetics.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sofa Area, a low-profile white sofa measuring 2.5 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.7 meters is recommended. The TV Stand Area features a simple wooden TV stand with dimensions of 1.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.5 meters, supporting a modern black TV measuring 1.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.7 meters. The Rug Area includes a black geometric rug sized 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters. The Coffee Table Area suggests a sleek coffee table, while the Side Table Areas propose two small wooden side tables, each measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters. The Lighting Area includes a minimalist black floor lamp with dimensions of 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.5 meters. The Decor Area features two gray cushions, each measuring 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.15 meters, to complement the sofa.

## 4. Scene Graph
The white sofa is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to provide a comfortable seating area that aligns with the minimalist design. Its dimensions of 2.5 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.7 meters fit well against the wall, leaving ample room for other elements. The placement ensures functionality and interaction with the rest of the room's elements, maintaining simplicity and coherence.

The wooden TV stand is positioned against the north wall, facing the south wall, and is centered relative to the sofa. This placement ensures optimal viewing angles from the sofa and maintains a balanced aesthetic. The TV stand's dimensions of 1.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.5 meters fit comfortably against the wall, complementing the minimalist style.

The modern black TV is placed on the TV stand, ensuring it is at a comfortable viewing height and directly faces the sofa. The TV's dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.7 meters fit well on the TV stand, maintaining balance and proportion with the existing furniture.

The black geometric rug is placed centrally in front of the sofa, defining the seating area and creating a cohesive look. Its dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters fit comfortably in front of the sofa, maintaining balance and avoiding obstruction of views.

The side table is placed on the south wall, to the left of the sofa, serving as a convenient surface for items. Its dimensions of 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters fit well beside the sofa, maintaining open space and a minimalist aesthetic.

The floor lamp is placed in the south-west corner of the room, next to the side table, providing necessary lighting for the seating area. Its dimensions of 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.5 meters ensure it does not obstruct views or foot traffic, complementing the room's minimalist design.

The gray cushions are placed on the sofa, enhancing comfort and aesthetic value. Their dimensions of 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.15 meters fit comfortably on the sofa, adding a subtle contrast that complements the minimalist design.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified due to the limited length of the south wall, which could not accommodate all intended objects. The coffee table was removed to resolve this conflict, as it was deemed less critical compared to the sofa, rug, and TV stand, which are essential to the user's minimalist vision. This adjustment ensures the room remains functional and adheres to the user's aesthetic preferences.

For cushion_2
- parent object: sofa_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with sofa_1
        - calculation:
            - Rotation of cushion_2: 0.0°
            - Rotation of sofa_1: 0.0°
            - Rotation difference: |0.0 - 0.0| = 0.0°
        - conclusion: Using length dimension for directional constraint
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'on' relation
        - calculation:
            - cushion_2 size: 0.4 (length)
            - Cluster size (on): max(0.0, 0.4) = 0.4
        - conclusion: cushion_2 cluster size (on): 0.4
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'sofa_1' constraint
        - calculation:
            - cushion_2 size: length=0.4, width=0.4, height=0.15
            - x_min = 2.3090730033795097 - 2.5/2 + 0.4/2 = 1.2590730033795097
            - x_max = 2.3090730033795097 + 2.5/2 - 0.4/2 = 3.3590730033795095
            - y_min = 0.45 - 0.9/2 + 0.4/2 = 0.2
            - y_max = 0.45 + 0.9/2 - 0.4/2 = 0.7
            - z_min = z_max = 0.35 + 0.7/2 + 0.15/2 = 0.7749999999999999
        - conclusion: Possible position: (1.2590730033795097, 3.3590730033795095, 0.2, 0.7, 0.7749999999999999, 0.7749999999999999)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(1.2590730033795097-3.3590730033795095), y(0.2-0.7)
            - Final coordinates: x=3.0083952801487825, y=0.6707439483625539, z=0.7749999999999999
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 3.0083952801487825, y: 0.6707439483625539, z: 0.7749999999999999
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=3.0083952801487825, y=0.6707439483625539, z=0.7749999999999999
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 3.0083952801487825, y: 0.6707439483625539, z: 0.7749999999999999
