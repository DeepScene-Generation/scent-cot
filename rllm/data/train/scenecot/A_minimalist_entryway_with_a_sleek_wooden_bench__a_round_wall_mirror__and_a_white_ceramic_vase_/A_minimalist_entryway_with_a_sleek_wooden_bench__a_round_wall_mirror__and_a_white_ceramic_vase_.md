## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a minimalist entryway that incorporates essential elements such as a wooden bench, a round wall mirror, and a white ceramic vase. The space is intended to be open and airy, adhering to a minimalist aesthetic with a cohesive color scheme. The south wall is designated as the main feature wall, where the bench and mirror are placed to provide seating and a visual check before exiting. The bench serves as a place to remove shoes and temporarily set down items, aligning with the functional requirements and minimalist style. The round wall mirror enhances the visual openness and serves a practical purpose for a last-minute check before leaving. The white ceramic vase, with a single stem of greenery, offers a subtle decorative element, maintaining simplicity while adding elegance. Additional elements such as a coat rack, shoe rack, small console table, and minimalist clock are considered to enhance the entryway's functionality and aesthetic without cluttering the space.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The entryway is decomposed into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The primary substructure is the Feature Wall Area on the south wall, which includes the bench, mirror, and vase, serving as the focal point for seating and visual checks. The Storage Area is designed for functional elements like the coat rack and shoe rack, providing practical storage solutions. The Decorative Area includes the vase and plant, adding elegance and maintaining the minimalist aesthetic. The Timekeeping Area features the clock, ensuring functionality without disrupting the minimalist style. Lastly, the Temporary Storage Area is represented by the console table on the east wall, offering a space for temporary storage while maintaining the room's sleek design.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Feature Wall Area, a natural wood-colored wooden bench (1.5m x 0.4m x 0.45m) is recommended for seating, complemented by a round wall mirror (0.8m x 0.8m x 0.02m) for visual checks. A white ceramic vase (0.15m x 0.15m x 0.3m) is suggested for decorative purposes. In the Storage Area, a minimalist metal coat rack (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.7m) and a metal shoe rack (0.8m x 0.3m x 0.4m) are proposed to enhance functionality. The Decorative Area includes a ceramic plant (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.0m) to add visual interest. The Timekeeping Area features a minimalist metal clock (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.05m) for practical purposes. Lastly, a wooden console table (1.0m x 0.3m x 0.75m) is recommended for the Temporary Storage Area, providing a sleek storage solution.

## 4. Scene Graph
The bench is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, as it is a primary object for seating and should be immediately accessible upon entering the room. Its natural wood color complements the minimalist style, and its placement ensures easy access without obstructing movement, maintaining functionality and aesthetic simplicity.

The round wall mirror is mounted on the south wall directly above the bench, centered for balance and aesthetic appeal. This placement maintains visual coherence and aligns with the user's minimalist theme, ensuring functionality for visual checks while entering or leaving the room.

The white ceramic vase is placed centrally on the bench, serving as a decorative element that enhances the aesthetic appeal without compromising the bench's usability. Its small size ensures it does not obstruct seating or interfere with the mirror above.

The coat rack is positioned on the south wall to the left of the bench, facing the north wall. This placement ensures it remains unobstructed and easily accessible for use, maintaining simplicity and functionality in the minimalist entryway.

The shoe rack is placed on the south wall to the right of the bench, facing the north wall. This placement provides functional synergy with the bench, allowing users to sit while wearing or removing shoes, and maintains balance and proportion in the space.

The console table is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement avoids clutter on the south wall and maintains the minimalist aesthetic, providing a space for temporary storage without interfering with existing objects.

The clock is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, ensuring easy visibility upon entry. Its minimalist style complements the existing decor, maintaining balance and symmetry in the room.

The plant is placed on the south wall, right of the shoe rack, facing the north wall. This placement enhances the aesthetic without disrupting the functionality of the entryway, maintaining balance and proportion.

The basket is placed on the shoe rack, right of the bench, facing the north wall. This placement ensures easy access and maintains the minimalist aesthetic, providing convenient storage near the entryway.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts were identified. The console table was too small to accommodate all intended objects, leading to the removal of the tray to maintain the minimalist aesthetic and functionality. Additionally, the south wall was overcrowded, necessitating the removal of the umbrella stand to ensure the remaining objects fit comfortably and align with the user's preference for a sleek wooden bench, round wall mirror, and white ceramic vase. These adjustments resolved spatial conflicts while preserving the minimalist style and functionality of the entryway.

            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.075-4.925), y(0.075-0.075)
            - Final coordinates: x=1.2904130362138857, y=0.075, z=0.6
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 1.2904130362138857, y: 0.075, z: 0.6
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=1.2904130362138857, y=0.075, z=0.6
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 1.2904130362138857, y: 0.075, z: 0.6

For coat_rack_1
- parent object: bench_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with bench_1
        - calculation:
            - Rotation of coat_rack_1: 0.0°
            - Rotation of bench_1: 0.0°
            - Rotation difference: |0.0 - 0.0| = 0.0°
        - conclusion: Using length dimension for directional constraint
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'left of' relation
        - calculation:
            - bench_1 size: 1.5 (length)
            - Cluster size (left of): max(0.0, 0.3) = 0.3
        - conclusion: coat_rack_1 cluster size (left of): 0.3
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'south_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - coat_rack_1 size: length=0.3, width=0.3, height=1.7
            - x_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 0.3/2 = 0.15
            - x_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 0.3/2 = 4.85
            - y_min = y_max = 0.15
            - z_min = z_max = 0.85
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.15, 4.85, 0.15, 0.15, 0.85, 0.85)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.15-4.85), y(0.15-0.15)
            - Final coordinates: x=0.28330893523544487, y=0.15, z=0.85
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.28330893523544487, y: 0.15, z: 0.85
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=0.28330893523544487, y=0.15, z=0.85
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.28330893523544487, y: 0.15, z: 0.85
