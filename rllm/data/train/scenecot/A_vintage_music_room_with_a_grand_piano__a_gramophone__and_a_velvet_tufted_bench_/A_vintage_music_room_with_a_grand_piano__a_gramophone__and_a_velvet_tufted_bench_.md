## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a vintage music room that evokes nostalgia and accommodates the functional needs of playing the piano and listening to vinyl records. The room is specified to be 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a grand piano, a gramophone, and a velvet tufted bench, all contributing to a vintage atmosphere. The user also wishes to display antique sheet music, enhancing the room's nostalgic appeal. The room should not exceed ten objects to maintain a balanced and uncluttered aesthetic.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Grand Piano Area is central, serving as the primary zone for playing music. The Gramophone Setup is positioned on the north wall, creating a dedicated space for listening to music. The Sheet Music Display is located on the south wall, showcasing antique sheet music and contributing to the room's vintage ambiance. These substructures ensure that each element fulfills its functional and aesthetic role within the room.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Grand Piano Area, a vintage-style grand piano with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters by 1.2 meters is recommended, accompanied by a velvet tufted bench measuring 1.2 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters. The Gramophone Setup includes a vintage brass gramophone, compact in size at 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meter. The Sheet Music Display features a tall, narrow wooden display measuring 2.0 meters by 0.1 meters by 1.5 meters. Additional recommendations include a vintage crystal chandelier (0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 1.0 meter) for lighting, an antique Persian-patterned rug (3.0 meters by 2.0 meters), a vintage wooden music stand (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.2 meters), and a brass wall sconce (0.2 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.4 meters) for ambient lighting.

## 4. Scene Graph
The grand piano is the focal point of the room, placed centrally to allow easy access and a sense of grandeur. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m x 1.2m) fit comfortably in the middle of the room, facing the north wall, ensuring it is accessible from all sides and does not obstruct movement. This placement aligns with the vintage aesthetic and maintains balance and proportion.

The velvet tufted bench is positioned behind the grand piano, facing the south wall. This placement ensures functionality by providing seating for piano playing and complements the vintage style with its deep red color. The bench's dimensions (1.2m x 0.5m x 0.5m) allow it to fit seamlessly behind the piano without spatial conflicts.

The gramophone, a key decorative and functional piece, is placed on the floor adjacent to the bench, facing the east wall. Its compact size (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) allows it to fit without overlapping with the piano or bench, creating a balanced and symmetrical setup.

The sheet music display is placed against the north wall, to the left of the grand piano. Its tall and narrow design (2.0m x 0.1m x 1.5m) minimizes its footprint, ensuring it remains accessible for use during piano sessions without obstructing pathways.

The chandelier is centrally placed on the ceiling, providing adequate lighting and complementing the vintage theme. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.8m x 1.0m) ensure it does not interfere with the room's height or other objects, maintaining symmetry and balance.

The antique rug is placed on the floor beneath the grand piano and partially under the bench. Its size (3.0m x 2.0m) fits comfortably within the room, enhancing the vintage aesthetic and providing a cohesive look.

The music stand is positioned to the left of the grand piano, facing the east wall. Its compact dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.2m) allow it to be placed adjacent to the piano without obstructing movement, supporting its functionality for holding sheet music.

The wall sconce is mounted on the north wall above the sheet music display, providing ambient lighting for the piano and music reading area. Its placement ensures it is functional and aesthetically pleasing, adhering to the room's vintage theme.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed considering their dimensions and the room's layout, ensuring no spatial conflicts or obstructions. The room's design maintains balance and functionality, adhering to the user's vintage aesthetic preferences.
