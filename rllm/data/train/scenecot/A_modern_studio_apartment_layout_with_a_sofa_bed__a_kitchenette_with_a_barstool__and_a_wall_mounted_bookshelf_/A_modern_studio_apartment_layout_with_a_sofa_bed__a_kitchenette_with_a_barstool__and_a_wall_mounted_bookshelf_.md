## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern studio apartment that emphasizes functionality and minimalism. Key elements include a sofa bed, kitchenette, barstool, and a wall-mounted bookshelf. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user desires a layout that supports multiple functions such as sleeping, cooking, dining, and reading, while maintaining an open and uncluttered space. The design should reflect a modern aesthetic with a focus on balance and proportion.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Sofa Bed Area serves as the central living and sleeping space. The Kitchenette Area is designated for cooking and dining, featuring a barstool and countertop. The Reading Area includes a wall-mounted bookshelf to store books without occupying floor space. Additionally, a Leisure Area is defined by a coffee table and rug, providing a space for relaxation and social interaction.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sofa Bed Area, a modern grey fabric sofa bed (3.211m x 1.018m x 0.784m) is recommended to serve dual purposes of seating and sleeping. The Kitchenette Area includes a modern black metal barstool (0.386m x 0.43m x 0.807m) for dining. A white wooden wall-mounted bookshelf (1.2m x 0.3m x 0.8m) is suggested for the Reading Area. The Leisure Area features a transparent glass coffee table (1.31m x 0.787m x 0.409m) and a beige fabric rug (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.02m) to define the space. A modern silver metal lamp (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) is recommended for lighting, placed on a black wooden side table (0.627m x 0.621m x 0.836m) adjacent to the sofa bed.

## 4. Scene Graph
The sofa bed is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, to maximize space efficiency and maintain a central location for both seating and sleeping. Its dimensions (3.211m x 1.018m x 0.784m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, ensuring easy access to the rest of the room and aligning with the user's modern studio apartment preference. This placement preserves the dual functionality of the sofa bed and adheres to design principles of balance and proportion.

The barstool is positioned on the east wall, facing the west wall, to complement the kitchenette area. Its dimensions (0.386m x 0.43m x 0.807m) ensure it fits well within the space, maintaining a clear middle area in the room. This placement supports the studio apartment layout by designating a specific area for dining, ensuring functionality and aesthetic balance.

The bookshelf is mounted on the south wall, facing the north wall, to provide easy access and visual balance within the room. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.3m x 0.8m) allow it to store books without occupying floor space, adhering to the minimalist design principle and enhancing the room's spaciousness.

The coffee table is placed in front of the sofa bed, in the middle of the room, facing the north wall. Its transparent material and dimensions (1.31m x 0.787m x 0.409m) ensure it does not visually clutter the space, maintaining an open feel. This placement provides functionality for the sofa bed users while adhering to the modern design aesthetic.

The side table is positioned to the right of the sofa bed, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.627m x 0.621m x 0.836m) allow it to fit comfortably adjacent to the sofa bed, providing a convenient surface for items such as a lamp or books. This placement enhances the functionality and aesthetic appeal of the sofa bed area.

The rug is placed under the coffee table in the middle of the room, defining the open living area. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.02m) allow it to fit comfortably without overlapping other objects, enhancing the aesthetic appeal and providing a sense of balance and cohesion.

The lamp is placed on the side table to the right of the sofa bed, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) ensure it fits well on the side table, providing necessary lighting and enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the sofa bed area.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified regarding the width of the barstool being too small to accommodate the countertop and kitchen appliance. To resolve this, the countertop and kitchen appliance were removed, as they were deemed less critical to the user's preference for a modern studio apartment layout with a sofa bed, kitchenette with a barstool, and a wall-mounted bookshelf. This resolution maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal, ensuring a cohesive and uncluttered space.
