## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern kitchen that emphasizes social interaction and efficient cooking. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a center island, high stools, and a set of steel appliances. The kitchen should facilitate meal preparation, storage, and easy access to appliances, all while maintaining a modern aesthetic. The user's preferences highlight the importance of a central island for social interaction and meal preparation, complemented by high stools for seating.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The kitchen is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Island with High Stools serves as a social seating area, central to meal preparation and interaction. The Cooking Area is designated for meal preparation, featuring essential appliances. Storage Cabinets provide organization for utensils and ingredients. The Appliance Zone houses steel appliances, ensuring easy access and functionality. Lastly, the Lighting System ensures adequate illumination, enhancing both functionality and ambiance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Island with High Stools, a modern center island and high stools are recommended to facilitate meal preparation and social interaction. The Cooking Area includes a set of steel appliances: a refrigerator, oven, and dishwasher, essential for maintaining the modern look. Modern storage cabinets are suggested for the Storage Cabinets substructure to organize utensils and ingredients. The Appliance Zone is enhanced with a microwave and a range hood to improve functionality. Recessed lighting is recommended for the Lighting System to ensure proper illumination and ambiance.

## 4. Scene Graph
The center island, a key component of the modern kitchen, is placed centrally in the room (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.9m), facing the north wall. This central placement allows access from all sides, promoting social interaction and meal preparation. High stools (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.8m) are positioned on the south side of the island, facing the north wall, to provide seating without obstructing movement. The refrigerator (0.8m x 0.7m x 1.8m) is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, ensuring easy access to the island for meal preparation. The oven (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.9m) is positioned next to the refrigerator on the south wall, maintaining a cohesive appliance zone. The dishwasher (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.9m) is placed to the left of the refrigerator, also on the south wall, to ensure a logical workflow. Storage cabinets (1.0m x 0.5m x 2.0m) are placed on the east wall, facing the west wall, providing easy access from the center island. The range hood (0.9m x 0.5m x 0.5m) is installed above the oven on the south wall, ensuring effective ventilation. Recessed lights are installed in the ceiling, with one above the center island and another above the cooking area, providing balanced illumination.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the placement of the microwave, initially intended to be left of the oven, as the refrigerator occupied that space. To resolve this, the microwave was removed from the layout, as it was deemed less critical compared to the oven and refrigerator. This decision aligns with the user's preference for a modern kitchen with a center island and essential steel appliances, ensuring the room's functionality and aesthetic are preserved.
