## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a serene sunroom that serves as a peaceful retreat, emphasizing harmony between natural elements and furniture. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, is designed to be open and airy, with natural light streaming in. Key elements include a wicker sofa, a glass coffee table, and a tall potted palm tree, all contributing to a bohemian style. The functional needs focus on seating, surface area, and a visual connection with nature, ensuring the room remains uncluttered while fulfilling its intended use.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The sunroom is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Wicker Sofa Area is designated for relaxation and viewing the outdoors. The Glass Coffee Table Area provides a central surface for placing items. The Potted Palm Tree Area enhances the natural ambiance, while Sunlight Optimization through the south wall ensures the room is well-lit. Additional substructures include a Side Table Area for extra surface space, a Floor Lamp Area for ambient lighting, and a Rug Area to add warmth and texture.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Wicker Sofa Area, a bohemian-style wicker sofa measuring 2.0 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.9 meters is recommended. The Glass Coffee Table Area features a modern glass table (1.2 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters) to maintain an open feel. A tall potted palm tree (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 2.0 meters) is suggested for the Potted Palm Tree Area. A wooden side table (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.6 meters) complements the sofa, while a contemporary metal floor lamp (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.8 meters) provides ambient lighting. A bohemian-style cotton rug (2.5 meters by 1.5 meters) adds warmth, and decorative cushions enhance comfort and style.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wicker sofa is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to facilitate relaxation and provide a view of the outdoors. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.8m x 0.9m) ensure it fits comfortably without blocking pathways, aligning with the serene aesthetic. The glass coffee table is positioned in front of the sofa, centrally located in the room. Its transparent design (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.4m) complements the open atmosphere, providing a functional surface without overcrowding the space.

The potted palm tree is placed in the corner where the east wall meets the south wall, facing the west wall. This placement allows its height (0.5m x 0.5m x 2.0m) to be appreciated without overwhelming the room, enhancing the natural aesthetic. The side table is positioned to the right of the wicker sofa, providing additional surface space. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.6m) ensure it fits well beside the sofa, maintaining a cohesive style.

The floor lamp is placed left of the wicker sofa in the south-west corner, facing the north wall. Its height (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.8m) provides ambient lighting for the seating area without obstructing movement or views. The rug is placed under the glass coffee table, in front of the sofa, adding warmth and texture. Its size (2.5m x 1.5m) ensures it does not cause spatial conflicts, enhancing the room's aesthetic.

Decorative cushions are placed on the wicker sofa, facing the north wall. Their small size (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.1m) ensures no spatial conflict, enhancing comfort and style while maintaining balance and proportion.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were positioned to maintain the room's open and airy layout, adhering to the user's preferences and design principles. The arrangement ensures functionality and aesthetic appeal, with each object contributing to the serene sunroom atmosphere.
