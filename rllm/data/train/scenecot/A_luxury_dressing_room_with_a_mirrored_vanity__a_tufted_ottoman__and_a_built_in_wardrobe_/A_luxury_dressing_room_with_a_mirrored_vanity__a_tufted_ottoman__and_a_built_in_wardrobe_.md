## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a luxury dressing room featuring a mirrored vanity, a tufted ottoman, and a built-in wardrobe. These elements are intended to provide both functionality for dressing and storage while maintaining an elegant aesthetic. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user has expressed a preference for additional elements such as a modern vanity chair, a decorative table lamp, a small side table, a freestanding clothing rack, a large area rug, and wall art to enhance the luxurious atmosphere. The total number of objects should not exceed 12, ensuring each item contributes significantly to the room's function and design.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Vanity Area is designated for grooming and dressing, featuring the mirrored vanity and associated accessories. The Central Seating Area is highlighted by the tufted ottoman, serving as a focal point and additional seating. The Storage Area includes the built-in wardrobe and a clothing rack for displaying select outfits. The Decorative Area is enhanced with a large area rug and wall art to anchor the space and elevate the luxurious feel.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Vanity Area, a mirrored vanity with dimensions of 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.8 meters is recommended, accompanied by a cream-colored velvet vanity chair and a gold table lamp. The Central Seating Area features a tufted ottoman measuring 1.0 meter by 1.0 meter by 0.5 meter, paired with a gold side table (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.6 meters) for holding personal items. The Storage Area includes a built-in wardrobe (2.5 meters by 0.6 meters by 2.4 meters) and a gold clothing rack (1.0 meter by 0.5 meter by 1.5 meters). The Decorative Area is enhanced with a cream wool area rug (3.0 meters by 2.0 meters) and multi-colored wall art (1.2 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.9 meters).

## 4. Scene Graph
The mirrored vanity is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, serving as a central luxurious feature in the room. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.5m x 1.8m) fit well against the wall, providing stability and allowing for comfortable use. This placement ensures the vanity is a focal point upon entering the room, enhancing the luxury ambiance without obstructing movement pathways.

The vanity chair is positioned directly in front of the mirrored vanity, facing the north wall. With dimensions of 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.9 meters, it fits comfortably without causing spatial conflicts, ensuring functionality for dressing and grooming. The cream-colored velvet material complements the gold of the vanity, maintaining the luxury aesthetic.

The table lamp is placed on the mirrored vanity, facing the south wall. Its compact size (0.253m x 0.23m x 0.435m) ensures it does not clutter the vanity, providing necessary lighting for grooming tasks while aligning with the luxury theme.

The tufted ottoman is centrally located in the room, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 1.0m x 0.5m) allow it to serve as additional seating or a resting spot for items without obstructing the function of the vanity or chair. This placement maintains a balanced look and enhances the room's luxury aesthetic.

The side table is placed on the floor, facing the north wall, next to the tufted ottoman on the east side. With dimensions of 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.6 meters, it provides functionality by holding items while seated on the ottoman, maintaining the room's luxurious aesthetic without obstructing movement.

The built-in wardrobe is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. Its substantial size (2.5m x 0.6m x 2.4m) is balanced by the mirrored vanity on the north wall, providing ample storage without disrupting the room's balance or accessibility.

The clothing rack is placed on the west wall, adjacent to the built-in wardrobe, facing the east wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.5m x 1.5m) ensure it complements the wardrobe without obstructing movement, maintaining functionality and the luxury theme.

The area rug is placed in the middle of the room, under the tufted ottoman and side table. Its large size (3.0m x 2.0m) visually anchors the space, providing a soft surface underfoot and enhancing the room's aesthetic without interfering with other furniture.

The wall art is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.1m x 0.9m) fit comfortably without obstructing other elements, adding visual interest and complementing the luxury theme.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed in a manner that aligns with the user's luxury theme and functional requirements, ensuring a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing room design.
