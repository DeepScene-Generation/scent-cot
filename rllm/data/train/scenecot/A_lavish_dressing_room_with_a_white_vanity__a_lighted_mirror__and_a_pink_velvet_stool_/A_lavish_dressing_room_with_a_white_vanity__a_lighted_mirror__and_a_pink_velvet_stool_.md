## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a lavish dressing room characterized by a white vanity, a lighted mirror, and a pink velvet stool, which are essential for both functionality and aesthetic appeal. The room is designed to exude luxury and comfort, with an open central space for trying on outfits. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes a luxurious atmosphere, requiring adequate lighting and additional elements like a wardrobe, rug, and decorative items to enhance elegance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key substructures based on user requirements. The Vanity Area is the focal point, featuring the vanity, lighted mirror, and stool. The Central Open Space is reserved for outfit evaluation and movement, ensuring unobstructed passage. The Storage Area includes a wardrobe for clothes storage, while the Comfort Area features a rug for added comfort. The Decorative Area includes elements like a vase and artwork to enhance the room's elegance. Finally, the Lighting Area is designed to provide ambient illumination through a chandelier.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Vanity Area, a modern white vanity (1.2m x 0.5m x 0.8m) with a lighted mirror (1.0m x 0.1m x 0.8m) and a pink velvet stool (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.45m) is recommended. The Storage Area features a modern white wardrobe (1.5m x 0.6m x 2.0m) for clothes storage. The Comfort Area includes a beige wool rug (2.0m x 2.0m x 0.01m) to enhance comfort. The Decorative Area is adorned with a modern white ceramic vase (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.5m) and multicolor canvas artwork (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.0m). The Lighting Area is completed with a classic gold crystal chandelier (0.8m x 0.8m x 1.0m) for ambient lighting.

## 4. Scene Graph
The vanity is a central element in the dressing room, placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures the lighted mirror receives optimal ambient light, aligning with the user's preference for a luxurious feel. The vanity's dimensions (1.2m x 0.5m x 0.8m) fit comfortably along the south wall, providing balance and proportion to the room. The lighted mirror is mounted directly above the vanity on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.1m x 0.8m) fit well above the vanity, enhancing grooming functionality and maintaining aesthetic continuity.

The pink velvet stool is placed directly in front of the vanity, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.45m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing movement, providing a practical seating solution for makeup application. The wardrobe is positioned on the north wall, facing the south wall. Its substantial size (1.5m x 0.6m x 2.0m) ensures stability and accessibility, complementing the room's functionality and aesthetic.

The rug is placed on the floor under the stool and partially extending under the vanity, central to the grooming area. Its dimensions (2.0m x 2.0m x 0.01m) provide comfort and define the grooming space without obstructing access to the wardrobe. The chandelier is centrally placed on the ceiling, facing downwards, providing even ambient lighting. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.8m x 1.0m) ensure it complements the room's decor while adhering to the user's vision of a lavish dressing room.

The vase is placed on the vanity, positioned between the lighted mirror and the edge of the vanity. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.5m) allow it to enhance the vanity's visual appeal without obstructing functionality. The artwork is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.0m) ensure it serves as a standalone decorative piece, enhancing the room's overall design.

## 5. Global Check
There were no conflicts identified during the placement process. All objects were placed in a manner that avoids spatial conflicts and aligns with the user's preferences and design principles. The room's layout ensures a balanced distribution of furniture, maintaining an open and luxurious atmosphere.
