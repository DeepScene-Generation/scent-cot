## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a modern kitchen that balances functionality and aesthetics, with specific appliances such as a stainless steel refrigerator, a black oven, and a white microwave oven. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The kitchen is intended to support culinary creativity and social gatherings, suggesting a need for open space and easy access to appliances. Additional items like a kitchen island, stools, a cutting board, a knife set, and a trash bin are considered to enhance functionality and maintain a sleek, minimal design.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The kitchen is divided into several functional areas: the Refrigeration Area for the refrigerator, the Cooking Area for the oven, the Microwave Area for the microwave, the Appliance Access Area for easy access to all appliances, and the Open Movement Area to facilitate fluid movement. These substructures ensure that each appliance and accessory serves its purpose while maintaining the kitchen's modern aesthetic.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Refrigeration Area, a modern stainless steel refrigerator is recommended. The Cooking Area features a black oven, while the Microwave Area includes a white microwave oven. The Open Movement Area is enhanced with a kitchen island for food preparation and dining, accompanied by stools for seating. A cutting board and knife set are suggested for the kitchen island to optimize food preparation. A trash bin is recommended for waste management, and recessed lights are proposed to ensure adequate lighting throughout the kitchen.

## 4. Scene Graph
The refrigerator is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, to ensure easy access and stability. Its dimensions are 0.9 meters in length, 0.7 meters in width, and 1.8 meters in height. This placement maintains open space and aligns with the modern aesthetic, allowing for a logical kitchen workflow.

The oven is positioned on the south wall, facing the north wall, with dimensions of 0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.9 meters. This placement balances the layout and ensures easy access, forming a functional triangle with the refrigerator and microwave.

The microwave is placed above the oven on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions are 0.706 meters by 0.596 meters by 0.405 meters. This vertical placement optimizes space and maintains the kitchen's aesthetic appeal and functionality.

The kitchen island is centrally located in the middle of the room, facing the north wall, with dimensions of 1.5 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.9 meters. This central placement facilitates accessibility from all sides and aligns with the user's input for a modern kitchen.

Two stools are placed in front of the kitchen island, facing the north wall. Each stool measures 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.6 meters. Their placement enhances the seating area around the kitchen island, maintaining open movement areas.

The cutting board is placed on the kitchen island, with dimensions of 0.4 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.02 meters. This placement ensures easy access for food preparation without obstructing seating arrangements.

The knife set is also placed on the kitchen island, adjacent to the cutting board, with dimensions of 0.1 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.3 meters. This placement keeps preparation tools organized and accessible.

The trash bin is placed on the south wall, to the left of the oven, facing the north wall. Its dimensions are 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.7 meters. This placement ensures easy access for waste disposal without obstructing movement.

Recessed lights are installed on the ceiling to provide balanced lighting. Recessed_light_1 is centrally located above the kitchen island, recessed_light_2 is above the refrigerator, and recessed_light_3 is above the oven. Each light measures 0.1 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.1 meters, ensuring even illumination throughout the kitchen.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. Each object is positioned to ensure functionality and aesthetic coherence, maintaining open movement areas and adhering to the user's modern kitchen preferences.
