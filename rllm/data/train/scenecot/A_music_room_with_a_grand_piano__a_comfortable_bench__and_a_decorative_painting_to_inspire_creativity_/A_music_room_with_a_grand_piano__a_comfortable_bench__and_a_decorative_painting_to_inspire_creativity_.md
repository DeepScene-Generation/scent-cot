## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a music room that prominently features a grand piano, accompanied by a bench and a decorative painting. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, is designed to accommodate these elements while ensuring optimal acoustic integrity and lighting. The user emphasizes the need for a harmonious and inspiring environment, suggesting the inclusion of soundproof panels and appropriate lighting to enhance both functionality and aesthetics.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key areas based on the user's requirements. The central area is designated for the grand piano, which serves as the focal point of the room. The east wall is reserved for the decorative painting, providing visual inspiration. The remaining walls are utilized for acoustic enhancements, with soundproof panels placed strategically to optimize sound quality. The lighting area is positioned to ensure adequate illumination for musical activities.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central area, a classic black grand piano with dimensions of 2.5 meters by 1.5 meters by 1.2 meters is recommended. A matching piano bench, measuring 1.0 meter by 0.4 meters by 0.5 meters, complements the piano. The east wall features an abstract decorative painting, sized at 1.2 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.8 meters, to inspire creativity. Modern gray soundproof panels, each 0.6 meters by 0.05 meters by 2.0 meters, are suggested for the west, east, and north walls to enhance acoustics. A contemporary silver floor lamp, measuring 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.6 meters, is recommended to provide optimal lighting.

## 4. Scene Graph
The grand piano, a central and substantial piece, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement allows for optimal sound projection and accessibility, creating a focal point in the room while leaving ample space for other elements. The piano's dimensions (2.5m x 1.5m x 1.2m) fit comfortably within the room, ensuring balance and proportion.

The piano bench is positioned directly in front of the grand piano, facing the north wall. This placement ensures comfortable seating for playing the piano, aligning with user preferences for a functional music room. The bench's dimensions (1.0m x 0.4m x 0.5m) allow for a natural and practical arrangement, maintaining balance and scale within the room.

The decorative painting is hung on the east wall, centered vertically to ensure visibility and aesthetic appeal. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.05m x 0.8m) fit comfortably within the space, adding visual interest without overwhelming the wall. This placement aligns with the user's desire for inspiration and creativity.

The music stand is placed to the left of the piano bench, facing the north wall. This positioning ensures easy access for the pianist, maintaining functionality and aesthetic appeal. The stand's dimensions (0.5m x 0.4m x 1.2m) allow it to fit comfortably in the available space, adhering to design principles by keeping related objects together.

Soundproof panel 1 is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, to enhance acoustic control. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.05m x 2.0m) ensure it does not interfere with existing objects, maintaining balance and proportion within the room. Soundproof panel 2 is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall, complementing the first panel to optimize sound absorption. Soundproof panel 3 is positioned on the north wall, facing the south wall, to further enhance acoustics and maintain a balanced layout.

The floor lamp is placed to the right of the piano bench, facing the north wall. This placement ensures the lamp provides adequate lighting for the piano area without obstructing movement. The lamp's dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.6m) allow it to fit comfortably beside the bench, complementing the room's design and functionality.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The arrangement of objects within the room adheres to user preferences and design principles, ensuring a harmonious and functional music room environment.

    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with north_wall
        - calculation:
            - Rotation of soundproof_panel_3: 180°
            - Rotation of north_wall: 180°
            - Rotation difference: |180 - 180| = 0°
        - conclusion: Using width dimension for directional constraint
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'on' relation
        - calculation:
            - soundproof_panel_3 size: 0.6 (length)
            - Cluster size (on): max(0.0, 0.0) = 0.0
        - conclusion: soundproof_panel_3 cluster size (on): 0.0
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'north_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - soundproof_panel_3 size: length=0.6, width=0.05, height=2.0
            - x_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 0.6/2 = 0.3
            - x_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 0.6/2 = 4.7
            - y_min = 5.0 - 0.0/2 - 0.05/2 = 4.975
            - y_max = 5.0 - 0.0/2 - 0.05/2 = 4.975
            - z_min = 2.0/2 = 1.0
            - z_max = 2.0/2 = 1.0
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.3, 4.7, 4.975, 4.975, 1.0, 1.0)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.3-4.7), y(4.975-4.975)
            - Final coordinates: x=4.399551211678156, y=4.975, z=1.0
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 4.399551211678156, y: 4.975, z: 1.0
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=4.399551211678156, y=4.975, z=1.0
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 4.399551211678156, y: 4.975, z: 1.0
