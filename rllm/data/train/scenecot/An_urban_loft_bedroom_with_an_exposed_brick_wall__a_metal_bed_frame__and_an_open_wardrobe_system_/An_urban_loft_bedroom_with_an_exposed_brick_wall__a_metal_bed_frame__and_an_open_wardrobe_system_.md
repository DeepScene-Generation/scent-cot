## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires an urban loft bedroom characterized by industrial aesthetics, with specific features such as an exposed brick wall, a metal bed frame, and an open wardrobe system. The room is designed to emphasize open space and natural light, particularly from a large south-facing window. The user has not requested any window treatments, indicating a preference for unobstructed light and views. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for the desired layout and style.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Sleeping Area is centered around the metal bed frame, positioned against the exposed brick wall to highlight the industrial style. The Wardrobe Area features an open wardrobe system, ensuring accessibility and aesthetic consistency. The Open Central Area benefits from natural light and expansive views, with a rug to define the space and add warmth. The Seating Area includes a chair for relaxation, strategically placed to complement the room's layout and style.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sleeping Area, a metal bed frame with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.6 meters by 0.5 meters is recommended, accompanied by two industrial-style bedside tables (0.4 meters by 0.322 meters by 0.55 meters) and matching lamps (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters). The Wardrobe Area features a modular open wardrobe system measuring 2.0 meters by 0.6 meters by 2.0 meters. In the Open Central Area, a gray rug (2.5 meters by 1.5 meters) is suggested to define the space. The Seating Area includes a metal chair (0.7 meters by 0.7 meters by 0.9 meters) to enhance functionality and style. The exposed brick wall, a key design element, is integrated into the room's aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The metal bed frame is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to align with the user's preference for an exposed brick wall and industrial style. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.6m x 0.5m) fit comfortably within the room, ensuring functionality and aesthetic balance. This placement highlights the industrial style and provides an open view of the room, enhancing natural light access.

The first bedside table is placed on the south wall, to the right of the bed, facing the north wall. This placement ensures easy access and complements the bed's industrial design. The table's dimensions (0.4m x 0.322m x 0.55m) allow it to fit without causing spatial conflicts, maintaining balance and proportion.

The second bedside table is symmetrically placed on the south wall, to the left of the bed, facing the north wall. This placement enhances visual harmony and balance, aligning with the user's urban loft aesthetic. Its dimensions match the first table, ensuring functionality and accessibility.

Lamp_1 is placed on top of the first bedside table, facing the north wall. Its compact size (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) fits comfortably on the table, providing effective lighting for the sleeping area. This placement ensures accessibility and complements the room's industrial style.

Lamp_2 is placed on the second bedside table, facing the north wall. This symmetrical placement ensures balanced lighting on both sides of the bed, adhering to aesthetic and functional requirements. Its dimensions match Lamp_1, maintaining consistency in design.

The wardrobe is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.6m x 2.0m) allow it to span the wall without obstructing movement, providing a visual anchor opposite the bed. This placement maximizes storage accessibility while maintaining the room's industrial aesthetic.

The chair is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (0.7m x 0.7m x 0.9m) ensure it does not obstruct movement or other furniture, offering a cohesive layout. This placement enhances the room's functionality and complements the open wardrobe system and exposed brick wall.

The rug is placed in the middle of the room, with its length running parallel to the bed on the south wall and its width extending towards the chair on the east wall and the wardrobe on the west wall. Its dimensions (2.5m x 1.5m) define the central area, adding warmth and cohesion to the space without cluttering the room.

The exposed brick wall is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement allows it to be a central design feature, enhancing the urban loft style without disrupting the functionality of other elements. Its dimensions (5.0m x 0.3m x 3.0m) ensure it serves as a prominent aesthetic feature.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed in a manner that respects the room's dimensions and the user's preferences, ensuring a harmonious and functional layout. The industrial style is consistently maintained throughout the room, with each object complementing the overall aesthetic and functional requirements.
