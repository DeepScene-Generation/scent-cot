## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user has specified the need for a functional laundry room with a modern aesthetic, featuring essential elements such as a front-loading washing machine, a shelf unit for organizing supplies, and a folding ironing board. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for these components. Additional preferences include a laundry basket, clothes drying rack, and a ventilation system to enhance functionality and maintain organization within the space.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to accommodate the user's requirements. The Washing Machine Area is located along the south wall, providing a dedicated space for the washing machine and associated accessories. The Storage Area is positioned on the north wall, designed for the shelf unit to store laundry supplies. The Ironing Area is along the west wall, featuring the ironing board and a small storage unit for ironing accessories. The central area of the room is reserved for the Clothes Drying Area, ensuring ample space for air circulation. The ceiling is utilized for the Ventilation Area, ensuring effective air circulation throughout the room.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Washing Machine Area, a modern-style washing machine with dimensions of 0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.85 meters is recommended, accompanied by a floor mat to reduce vibration. The Storage Area features an industrial-style shelf unit measuring 1.2 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.8 meters for organizing supplies. The Ironing Area includes a contemporary ironing board (1.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.9 meters) and a modern storage unit (0.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.7 meters) for ironing accessories. The Clothes Drying Area is equipped with a compact drying rack (1.0 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meters) to facilitate air drying. The Ventilation Area includes an integrated ventilation system (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters) installed on the ceiling. Additionally, a traditional-style laundry basket (0.6 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.5 meters) and a modern utility cart (0.6 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.9 meters) are recommended for enhanced functionality.

## 4. Scene Graph
The washing machine is a fundamental component of the laundry room, placed on the south wall to allow easy access and utility. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.85m) fit comfortably against the wall, ensuring no spatial conflicts and aligning with the user's functional requirements. The floor mat, measuring 0.7m x 0.7m, is placed directly under the washing machine to reduce vibration, complementing the machine without disrupting the room's aesthetics.

The shelf unit is positioned on the north wall, facing the south wall, to store laundry supplies. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.3m x 1.8m) allow it to fit against the wall, maintaining balance and proportion within the room. This placement ensures accessibility and complements the room's modern/industrial theme.

The ironing board is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall, ensuring it is accessible for ironing tasks while maintaining a clear path between the washing machine and the shelf unit. Its dimensions (1.4m x 0.4m x 0.9m) allow it to fit along the wall without blocking access to other objects. The storage unit for ironing accessories is placed adjacent to the ironing board, ensuring easy access and maintaining an organized space.

The laundry basket is placed on the floor to the right of the washing machine, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.4m x 0.5m) allow it to fit comfortably beside the washing machine, facilitating easy use and maintaining the room's functionality and aesthetic balance.

The clothes drying rack is centrally placed in the room, facing the north wall, to ensure optimal airflow and easy access to the washing machine and other items. Its compact design (1.0m x 0.5m x 1.0m) allows for free movement around it, enhancing the room's functionality.

The ventilation system is installed on the ceiling, centrally located to maximize its ventilation coverage. Its compact size (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m) ensures it does not interfere with floor space or wall-mounted objects, enhancing the room's functionality without being intrusive.

The utility cart is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall, ensuring it is accessible and does not interfere with the function of the washing machine, ironing board, or other storage units. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.4m x 0.9m) allow it to serve as a mobile storage unit effectively while maintaining the room's overall aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process, as all objects were strategically positioned to avoid spatial conflicts and align with the user's functional and aesthetic preferences. The room's layout supports easy access and movement, ensuring a cohesive and efficient laundry space.
