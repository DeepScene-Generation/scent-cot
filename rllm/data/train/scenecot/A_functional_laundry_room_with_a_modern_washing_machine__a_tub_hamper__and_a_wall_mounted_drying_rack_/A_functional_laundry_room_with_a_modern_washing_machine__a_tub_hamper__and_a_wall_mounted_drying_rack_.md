## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user aims to create a functional laundry room with a modern aesthetic, emphasizing efficiency and ease of use. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a modern washing machine, a tub hamper, and a wall-mounted drying rack. The user desires a minimalist design that facilitates smooth movement and efficient task execution, with additional storage options for detergents and cleaning supplies.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional zones based on user requirements. The Washing Machine Zone is located on the south wall, serving as the primary area for washing clothes. Adjacent to it is the Tub Hamper Area, designed for temporary laundry storage. The Drying Rack Zone is positioned on the north wall, providing space for drying clothes. Additional areas include a Storage Zone on the south wall for cleaning supplies and a Sorting and Stain Treatment Area, which was initially planned but later removed due to spatial constraints.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Washing Machine Zone, a sleek, silver modern washing machine is recommended, measuring 0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.85 meters. The Tub Hamper Area features a stylish woven fabric tub hamper, sized at 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.7 meters, complementing the modern aesthetic. The Drying Rack Zone includes a retractable, wall-mounted drying rack made of metal, with dimensions of 1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 0.5 meters. A modern wooden storage cabinet, measuring 0.8 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.2 meters, is suggested for storing cleaning supplies.

## 4. Scene Graph
The washing machine is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement is chosen to optimize space and functionality, allowing easy access to plumbing and electrical connections. The washing machine's dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.85m) fit well against the wall, ensuring it does not occupy central floor space, which aligns with the user's preference for a functional setup.

Adjacent to the washing machine on the south wall is the tub hamper, facing the north wall. This placement ensures convenience for temporary laundry storage, maintaining visual and functional coherence with the washing machine. The tub hamper's dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.7m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing access to the washing machine.

The drying rack is mounted on the north wall, facing the south wall. This positioning ensures it is directly opposite the washing machine and tub hamper, maintaining a functional workflow and easy access. The drying rack's dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.5m) and wall-mounted design maximize floor space, ensuring it does not obstruct movement in the room.

The storage cabinet is placed on the south wall, to the left of the tub hamper, facing the north wall. This arrangement ensures easy access to cleaning supplies while maintaining a cohesive design. The cabinet's dimensions (0.8m x 0.4m x 1.2m) fit well within the available space, complementing the modern aesthetic and enhancing the room's functionality.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the initial placement of the storage cabinet to the right of the tub hamper, as the washing machine occupied that space. To resolve this, the storage cabinet was repositioned to the left of the tub hamper, maintaining adjacency and functionality. Additionally, due to spatial constraints, the ironing board, work table, shelf, and laundry basket were removed to prioritize the essential elements of the laundry room, aligning with the user's preference for a functional and modern setup.
