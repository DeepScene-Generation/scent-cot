## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a minimalist workspace that emphasizes simplicity and functionality, featuring a wooden desk, a black swivel chair, and a whiteboard for notes and reminders. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design aims for a clean, uncluttered appearance with a warm, natural ambiance, facilitating note-taking, comfortable seating, and a task-focused environment. Additional objects like a floor lamp, a plant, a small side table, and a minimalist clock are considered to enhance functionality and aesthetics while maintaining the minimalist style.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The workspace is divided into specific substructures based on user requirements. The whiteboard is positioned on the south wall for visibility and accessibility. The seating area includes a black swivel chair placed in front of the central wooden desk. The open middle area allows for movement and interaction. Additional areas include a lighting zone with a floor lamp, an aesthetic enhancement zone with a plant, and a functional zone with a minimalist clock.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central workspace, a minimalist wooden desk (1.4m x 0.7m x 0.75m) is recommended, complemented by a black swivel chair (0.6m x 0.6m x 1.1m) for comfortable seating. A whiteboard (1.2m x 0.1m x 0.9m) is suggested for note-taking. A floor lamp (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.8m) provides lighting, while a plant (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.8m) adds aesthetic value. A minimalist clock (0.4m x 0.05m x 0.4m) is included for timekeeping.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden desk is placed centrally against the north wall, facing the south wall, to provide a functional workspace that aligns with the minimalist aesthetic. Its dimensions (1.4m x 0.7m x 0.75m) allow for adequate space for other objects, such as the swivel chair and whiteboard. This placement ensures efficient use of space and adheres to design principles of balance and proportion.

The black swivel chair is positioned in front of the wooden desk, facing the north wall. This placement ensures comfortable and functional use of the workspace, with the chair's dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 1.1m) fitting comfortably in front of the desk. The chair's placement maintains balance and proportion, aligning with the minimalist style.

The whiteboard is mounted on the east wall, facing the west wall, ensuring visibility from the desk while maintaining a minimalist aesthetic. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.1m x 0.9m) allow for flexibility in placement, and it is centered on the wall to maintain visual harmony.

The floor lamp is placed to the right of the wooden desk, adjacent to it, and facing the north wall. This position provides adequate lighting for the desk area without obstructing movement or sightlines. The lamp's dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.8m) ensure it complements the minimalist style without cluttering the space.

The plant is placed on the north wall, to the left of the floor lamp, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.8m) allow it to fit into smaller spaces without overwhelming the room. This placement provides visual interest without interfering with workspace functionality.

The clock is placed on the south wall, directly opposite the wooden desk, ensuring it is within the line of sight for optimal functionality. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.05m x 0.4m) allow it to fit comfortably on the wall without overpowering other elements, enhancing the workspace's minimalism and maintaining a balanced design.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited space on the north wall, which could not accommodate all objects, including the floor lamp, side table, wooden desk, plant, whiteboard, and black swivel chair. To resolve this, the side table was removed, as it was deemed less critical to the user's preference for a minimalist workspace focused on the desk, chair, and whiteboard. This adjustment ensured the room maintained its minimalist style and functionality without overcrowding.
