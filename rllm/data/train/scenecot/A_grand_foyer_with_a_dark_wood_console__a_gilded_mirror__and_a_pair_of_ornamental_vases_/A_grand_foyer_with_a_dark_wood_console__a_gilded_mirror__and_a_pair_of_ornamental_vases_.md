## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a grand foyer characterized by a luxurious and welcoming atmosphere. Key elements include a dark wood console, a gilded mirror, and a pair of ornamental vases, which are essential for achieving the desired aesthetic. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user prefers a classic style with elements that enhance both functionality and elegance, such as a chandelier for ambient lighting, a luxurious rug for texture, and practical items like an umbrella stand for storage.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The foyer is divided into three main substructures: the console and mirror display area, the symmetrical vase arrangement, and the item placement surface. The console and mirror display area serves as the focal point, enhancing the room's elegance. The symmetrical vase arrangement on the console adds balance and aesthetic appeal. The item placement surface, including the console and surrounding elements, fulfills both functional and decorative purposes.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the console and mirror display area, a classic dark wood console (1.5m x 0.4m x 0.9m) is recommended, complemented by a gilded mirror (1.2m x 0.05m x 1.5m) to enhance space and light. The symmetrical vase arrangement includes two ornamental vases, each 0.3 meters wide, placed on the console. A chandelier (1.0m x 1.0m x 1.0m) is suggested for central ambient lighting. A luxurious oriental rug (3.0m x 2.0m) is proposed for the middle of the room to add texture and define the space. An umbrella stand (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.8m) near the entrance offers practical storage, while a pair of decorative wall sconces provide additional lighting and aesthetic appeal.

## 4. Scene Graph
The console is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, serving as the focal point upon entering the room. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.4m x 0.9m) fit well against the wall, providing ample space for the gilded mirror and ornamental vases. The mirror is centered above the console on the south wall, enhancing the console's presence and providing reflective elegance. Its size (1.2m x 0.05m x 1.5m) ensures it fits comfortably without touching the ceiling. Vase_1 is placed on the console, facing the north wall, complementing the existing setup and enhancing the foyer's elegance. Vase_2 is also placed on the console, to the right of vase_1, maintaining symmetry and grandeur. The chandelier is centrally placed, suspended from the ceiling, providing balanced ambient lighting. Its dimensions (1.0m x 1.0m x 1.0m) make it a prominent feature without overwhelming the space. The rug is placed in the middle of the room, enhancing visual appeal and providing a central anchor. Its dimensions (3.0m x 2.0m) allow it to complement the existing elements without spatial conflicts. The umbrella stand is placed on the floor, left of the console on the south wall, ensuring easy access and complementing the layout. Wall_sconce_1 is placed on the south wall, slightly above and to the right of the mirror, providing accent lighting. Wall_sconce_2 is symmetrically placed on the south wall, left of the mirror, enhancing the classical aesthetic. The decorative bowl, initially intended for the console, was removed due to space constraints.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose regarding the console's capacity to accommodate all intended objects, specifically vase_1, vase_2, and the decorative bowl. The user preference for a grand foyer with a pair of ornamental vases led to the decision to remove the decorative bowl, as it was deemed less critical to the overall design and functionality. This resolution maintained the user's vision of a symmetrical and elegant foyer while adhering to spatial limitations.
