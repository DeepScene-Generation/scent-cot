## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a craft room designed to facilitate crafting activities, organization, and inspiration. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a long workbench for crafting, ample shelving for supplies, and a pinboard for inspiration. The user emphasizes the need for natural lighting and a spacious atmosphere, achieved through a skylight. The room should allow for movement and flexibility, accommodating larger projects while maintaining a tidy and accessible environment.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures. The Workbench Area is the central workspace for crafting activities, requiring ergonomic and spacious design. The Storage Area, featuring shelving units, is essential for organizing supplies efficiently. The Inspiration Area includes a pinboard for displaying sketches and ideas, crucial for the creative process. The Lighting Area, enhanced by a skylight, ensures a bright and airy environment. The Open Central Area allows for movement and flexibility, accommodating larger projects.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Workbench Area, an industrial-style wooden workbench measuring 4.5 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.9 meters is recommended. The Storage Area includes a contemporary metal shelving unit (4.0 meters by 0.3 meters by 2.5 meters) for organizing supplies. A minimalist cork pinboard (2.0 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.5 meters) is suggested for the Inspiration Area. The Lighting Area features a modern glass skylight (1.5 meters by 1.5 meters by 0.1 meters) to provide natural lighting. Additional items include a modern metal table lamp (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.5 meters) for task lighting and a rustic woven storage basket (0.343 meters by 0.264 meters by 0.165 meters) for supply storage.

## 4. Scene Graph
The workbench, a central element for crafting, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement maximizes space usage and maintains accessibility, aligning with the user's preference for a craft room. The workbench's dimensions (4.5m x 0.8m x 0.9m) ensure it fits comfortably against the wall, maintaining balance and proportion in the room.

The shelving unit is positioned against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement maximizes storage space without obstructing the workbench, providing easy access to supplies. The shelving unit's dimensions (4.0m x 0.3m x 2.5m) fit comfortably against the wall, maintaining the room's aesthetic and practical flow.

The pinboard is placed on the west wall, facing east. This location ensures visibility from the workbench, enhancing the room's functionality as a craft space. The pinboard's dimensions (2.0m x 0.05m x 1.5m) allow it to fit without obstructing access to other elements.

The table lamp is placed on the workbench, providing task lighting for crafting activities. Its small size (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.5m) ensures it fits without overlapping other objects, complementing the industrial-modern aesthetic.

The storage basket is placed on the shelving unit, providing additional storage without taking up floor space. Its small dimensions (0.343m x 0.264m x 0.165m) ensure it fits comfortably, maintaining the room's open layout.

The inspiration board is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement ensures easy visibility and access from the workbench area, complementing the room's use as a craft room. The board's dimensions (1.5m x 0.05m x 1.2m) fit well within the available space.

The skylight is installed on the ceiling, centered above the room to provide even natural lighting. This placement ensures optimal light distribution, enhancing the room's ambiance and maintaining its modern aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
Two conflicts were identified during the placement process. First, the shelving unit was too small to accommodate both storage baskets. To resolve this, storage_basket_2 was removed, prioritizing the room's functionality and user preference for ample shelving. Second, the north wall could not accommodate both the workbench and the rolling cart. The rolling cart was removed, as the workbench is central to the room's purpose, ensuring the space remains functional and aesthetically cohesive.
