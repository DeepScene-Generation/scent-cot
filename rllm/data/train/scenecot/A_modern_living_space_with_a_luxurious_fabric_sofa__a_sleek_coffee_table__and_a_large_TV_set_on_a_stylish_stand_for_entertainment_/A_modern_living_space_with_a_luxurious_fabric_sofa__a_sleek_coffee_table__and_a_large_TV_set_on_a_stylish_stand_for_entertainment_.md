## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a modern living space that emphasizes luxury and functionality, featuring a luxurious fabric sofa, a sleek coffee table, and a large TV set on a stylish stand. These elements are central to the room's design, serving as key components for entertainment, relaxation, and social gatherings. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for the desired modern aesthetic and functional layout.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional zones based on the user's requirements. The Seating Area is defined by the placement of the sofa against the south wall, creating a comfortable space for relaxation. The Entertainment Area is centered around the TV and stand on the north wall, providing a focal point for viewing. The Coffee Table Zone is located in the middle of the room, serving as a central point for social interaction and holding items. Additional substructures include the Lighting Area, enhanced by a floor lamp, and the Decorative Zone, featuring a vase and decorative pillows to add style and comfort.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a modern fabric sofa measuring 2.5 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.8 meters is recommended, providing ample seating space. The Entertainment Area features a modern TV stand (1.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.6 meters) and a large TV (1.2 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.8 meters) to enhance the viewing experience. The Coffee Table Zone includes a sleek glass coffee table (1.2 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters) and a decorative vase (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.5 meters) to add visual interest. A modern wool rug (1.6 meters by 1.2 meters) is placed under the coffee table to define the area. The Lighting Area is enhanced by a modern metal floor lamp (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.5 meters) to provide ambient lighting, while decorative pillows (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters) add comfort and style to the sofa.

## 4. Scene Graph
The sofa is a significant piece of furniture, placed against the south wall to maximize space utilization and avoid crowding the room's center. Its dimensions (2.5m x 1.0m x 0.8m) fit well along the wall, allowing it to face the north wall, which aligns with the user's preference for a modern living space. This placement provides a clear viewing area for the TV stand on the north wall and leaves ample space for the coffee table in front.

The coffee table is centrally placed in front of the sofa, maintaining balance and accessibility. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.4m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing movement, enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal. This central placement is typical of modern living room setups, where coffee tables are positioned in front of sofas.

The TV stand is placed against the north wall, providing stability and ensuring the TV is at a proper viewing height. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.4m x 0.6m) fit comfortably against the wall, allowing the sofa to face the TV, creating a natural viewing arrangement. This placement enhances the room's entertainment function and aligns with the user's modern aesthetic.

The TV is placed on the TV stand, facing the south wall, ensuring optimal viewing from the sofa. Its size (1.2m x 0.1m x 0.8m) fits comfortably on the stand, maintaining a balanced aesthetic and enhancing the room's entertainment function.

The decorative pillow is placed on the sofa, providing comfort and a modern aesthetic touch. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m) fit well on the sofa, enhancing seating comfort and aligning with the user's preference for a luxurious living space.

The floor lamp is positioned to the left of the sofa, providing practical lighting for reading or ambiance. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.5m) allow it to fit comfortably beside the sofa without obstructing pathways or the TV view, enhancing the room's functionality and modern style.

The rug is placed in the middle of the room, directly under the coffee table, providing a soft and modern aesthetic to the seating area. Its dimensions (1.6m x 1.2m) fit well within the room's layout, enhancing the room's aesthetic and defining the seating arrangement.

The decorative vase is placed on the coffee table, serving as a decorative focal point. Its size (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.5m) fits well on the table, enhancing the room's modern design without interfering with functionality.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the TV stand's area being too small to accommodate both the TV and the sound system. To resolve this, the sound system was removed, as the TV is a higher priority for the user's preference for a modern living space focused on entertainment. This adjustment ensures the room maintains its modern aesthetic and functional layout without spatial conflicts.

            - x_min = 2.5714241146144805 - 1.2/2 + 0.3/2 = 2.1214241146144803
            - x_max = 2.5714241146144805 + 1.2/2 - 0.3/2 = 3.0214241146144807
            - y_min = 1.3 - 0.6/2 + 0.3/2 = 1.15
            - y_max = 1.3 + 0.6/2 - 0.3/2 = 1.4500000000000002
            - z_min = z_max = 0.65
        - conclusion: Possible position: (2.1214241146144803, 3.0214241146144807, 1.15, 1.4500000000000002, 0.65, 0.65)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(2.1214241146144803-3.0214241146144807), y(1.15-1.4500000000000002)
            - Final coordinates: x=2.8111865588613827, y=1.367313678473056, z=0.65
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 2.8111865588613827, y: 1.367313678473056, z: 0.65
    5. reason: Collision check with coffee_table_1
        - calculation:
            - Overlap detection: No overlap detected
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Final coordinates: x=2.8111865588613827, y=1.367313678473056, z=0.65
