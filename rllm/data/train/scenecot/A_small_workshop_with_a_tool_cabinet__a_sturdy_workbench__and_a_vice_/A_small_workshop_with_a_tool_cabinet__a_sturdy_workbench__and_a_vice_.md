## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a small workshop with specific functional needs, including a tool cabinet, a workbench with a vice, and ample workspace. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes the importance of organization and accessibility, requesting a tool cabinet for tool storage, a sturdy workbench for various tasks, and adequate lighting for detailed work. Additional requirements include a tool pegboard for frequently used tools, a comfortable stool for seating, storage bins for smaller materials, and a fire extinguisher for safety.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The workshop is divided into several functional substructures. The Tool Cabinet Area is designated for organizing tools, ensuring easy access and maintaining a clean appearance. The Workbench Area serves as the primary workspace, equipped with a vice for material holding. The Lighting Area focuses on providing bright, energy-efficient illumination over the workbench. The Tool Pegboard Area enhances tool organization above the tool cabinet. The Seating Area includes a stool for ergonomic seating at the workbench, while the Storage Area provides additional organization with bins under the workbench. Lastly, the Safety Area ensures easy access to a fire extinguisher.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Tool Cabinet Area, a sturdy metal tool cabinet with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.8 meters is recommended. The Workbench Area features a robust wooden workbench measuring 2.0 meters by 1.0 meters by 0.9 meters, integrated with a metal vice. The Lighting Area includes a modern LED light strip, 1.0 meter in length, installed above the workbench. The Tool Pegboard Area is equipped with a metal pegboard, 1.5 meters by 0.1 meters by 1.0 meters, for tool organization. The Seating Area includes a metal stool, 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.6 meters, for comfortable seating. The Storage Area features a plastic storage bin, 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.3 meters, for material storage. The Safety Area includes a standard metal fire extinguisher, 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.6 meters, for emergency use.

## 4. Scene Graph
The tool cabinet is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures easy access to tools while leaving ample space for the workbench and vice. The cabinet's dimensions (1.2m x 0.5m x 1.8m) fit well against the wall, maintaining balance and proportion in the room. The workbench is positioned on the north wall, facing the south wall, allowing easy access to the tool cabinet and leaving space for movement. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.9m) ensure a substantial work surface, with the vice integrated and facing the same direction. The vice is placed on the workbench, centrally positioned for balanced weight distribution and ease of access, with dimensions of 0.3m x 0.2m x 0.2m.

The LED light is installed on the ceiling, centered above the workbench, providing optimal illumination for the work area. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.2m x 0.1m) ensure it does not overwhelm the space. The tool pegboard is mounted on the south wall, directly above and adjacent to the tool cabinet, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.1m x 1.0m) fit well above the cabinet, enhancing tool organization. The stool is placed in front of the workbench, facing the south wall, allowing for comfortable seating while working. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.6m) ensure it does not occupy much space. The storage bin is placed on the floor to the right of the workbench, facing the south wall, ensuring easy access to materials. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.4m x 0.3m) fit comfortably without obstructing movement. The fire extinguisher is placed on the south wall, left of the tool cabinet, facing the north wall. Its compact size (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) ensures it is visible and accessible without obstructing access to other tools or work areas.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were positioned to avoid spatial conflicts, maintaining a functional and organized workshop environment. The arrangement adheres to user preferences and design principles, ensuring balance, proportion, and accessibility throughout the room.
