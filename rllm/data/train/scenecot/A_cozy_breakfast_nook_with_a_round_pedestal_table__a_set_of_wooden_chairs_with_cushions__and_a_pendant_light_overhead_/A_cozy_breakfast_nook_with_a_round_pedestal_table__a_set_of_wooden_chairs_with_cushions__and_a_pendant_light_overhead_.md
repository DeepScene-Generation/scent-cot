## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a cozy breakfast nook characterized by a round pedestal table, wooden chairs with cushions, and a pendant light overhead. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes a serene and inviting atmosphere, with a preference for a harmonious color palette and durable materials that reflect warmth. The layout should incorporate essential elements such as the south wall, middle of the room, and ceiling to determine the placement and style of the objects, ensuring a functional and aesthetically pleasing environment.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The scene is decomposed into several substructures based on the user's requirements. The central substructure is the Seating Area, which includes a round table and four chairs, designed to comfortably accommodate four people. The Lighting Area is defined by the placement of a pendant light overhead, providing ambient lighting for the table area. Additional substructures include a Decorative Area, featuring a small rug under the table, a potted plant on the side, and a wall clock to enhance the aesthetic appeal without cluttering the space.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a rustic round pedestal table with a diameter of 1.0 meter and four matching wooden chairs with beige cushions are recommended. The Lighting Area features a modern matte black pendant light with dimensions of 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.5 meters. The Decorative Area includes a bohemian-style cotton rug (1.5 meters by 1.5 meters), a natural ceramic potted plant (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.7 meters), and a vintage bronze wall clock (0.4 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.4 meters) to add texture and warmth to the room.

## 4. Scene Graph
The round pedestal table, a central element of the breakfast nook, is placed in the middle of the room to allow optimal circulation and accessibility from all sides. Its rustic style and natural wood color align with the user's preference for a cozy atmosphere. The table's dimensions (1.0m diameter, 0.75m height) fit well within the space, ensuring it serves as a focal point while maintaining balance and proportion.

Chair_1 is positioned to the right of the table, facing the west wall. Its rustic style and wooden material complement the table, and its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) ensure it fits comfortably around the table without spatial conflicts. Chair_2 is placed to the left of the table, facing the east wall, creating symmetry and allowing for comfortable seating. Chair_3 is positioned in front of the table, facing the south wall, maintaining a harmonious setup. Chair_4 is placed behind the table, facing the north wall, completing the symmetrical seating arrangement.

The pendant light is installed on the ceiling directly above the table, providing focused lighting for the dining area. Its modern style and matte black color enhance the room's aesthetic while ensuring effective illumination. The rug is placed on the floor under the table and chairs, defining the seating area and adding a bohemian touch. The potted plant is positioned on the floor adjacent to the east wall, facing the west wall, contributing to the room's natural ambiance. The wall clock is mounted on the south wall, ensuring visibility from the seating area and adding a vintage charm to the room.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The arrangement of objects ensures a balanced and functional layout, adhering to the user's preferences and design principles. The placement of each object was carefully considered to avoid spatial conflicts and maintain a cohesive and inviting atmosphere in the breakfast nook.
