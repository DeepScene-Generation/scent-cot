## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a minimalist living space characterized by modular seating, a low-profile coffee table, and a woolen rug. The room is intended to be serene and calming, emphasizing simplicity and functionality. The primary elements include a modular sofa set, a coffee table, and a rug, which fulfill the user's needs for seating, surface, and comfortable flooring. Additional recommendations to enhance the minimalist aesthetic and functionality include a floor lamp for lighting, a side table for extra surface space, minimalist decorative items for subtle personality, and a small indoor plant for a touch of nature. The room should maintain open pathways to ensure safe and comfortable navigation, adhering to minimalist design principles, with a total object count not exceeding ten to preserve functionality and aesthetic.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on user requirements. The Seating Area is centered around the modular sofa, providing a comfortable space for relaxation. The Surface Area includes the coffee table, offering a place for drinks and reading materials. The Flooring Area is defined by the woolen rug, adding comfort and style. The Lighting Area is enhanced by the floor lamp, ensuring adequate illumination. The Decorative Area includes the indoor plant, adding a natural element to the room. Each substructure is designed to maintain the minimalist aesthetic while fulfilling specific functional needs.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a minimalist modular sofa in gray fabric, measuring 3.211 meters in length, 1.018 meters in width, and 0.784 meters in height, is recommended. The Surface Area features a minimalist light wood coffee table, 1.05 meters by 1.05 meters by 0.35 meters, providing a functional surface. The Flooring Area includes a cream woolen rug, 2.997 meters by 1.962 meters, offering comfortable flooring. The Lighting Area is enhanced by a black metal floor lamp, 0.601 meters by 0.601 meters by 1.902 meters, providing necessary lighting. The Decorative Area features a green plastic indoor plant, 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.7 meters, adding a touch of nature.

## 4. Scene Graph
The modular sofa is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, to maximize open space and maintain a minimalist aesthetic. Its dimensions (3.211m x 1.018m x 0.784m) fit comfortably along the 5-meter wall, leaving ample space for other elements. This placement ensures easy movement around the room and aligns with design principles of balance and proportion, providing a comfortable seating area.

The coffee table is centrally located in front of the modular sofa, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.05m x 1.05m x 0.35m) allow for functional use without congestion, maintaining aesthetic balance. This placement facilitates easy access from the sofa and adheres to the minimalist theme by keeping the layout open and simple.

The woolen rug is placed on the floor, directly under the coffee table and partially extending under the front legs of the modular sofa. Its dimensions (2.997m x 1.962m) create a defined zone without interfering with the functionality of the sofa or table. This placement enhances the seating area, aligning with the user's preference for a minimalist aesthetic.

The floor lamp is positioned to the right of the modular sofa, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.601m x 0.601m x 1.902m) ensure it fits comfortably without obstructing pathways. This placement provides adequate lighting to the seating area, maintaining functionality and the minimalist aesthetic.

The indoor plant is placed on the floor, left of the floor lamp, and right of the modular sofa, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.7m) allow it to occupy minimal floor space, enhancing the room's aesthetic without hindering functionality. This placement creates a harmonious and inviting living space, consistent with the minimalist theme.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited length of the north wall, which could not accommodate all objects, including the modular sofa, coffee table, floor lamp, side table, and indoor plant. To resolve this, the side table and decorative vase were removed, as they were deemed less critical to the user's preference for a minimalist living space centered around the modular sofa, coffee table, and woolen rug. This adjustment ensured the room maintained its intended aesthetic and functionality without overcrowding.
