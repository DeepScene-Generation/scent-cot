## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions an elegant dining space characterized by a glass-topped round table, white high-back chairs, and a crystal chandelier. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, is intended to have a central dining area with unadorned walls and ceiling. The user emphasizes a sophisticated atmosphere, requiring functional and aesthetic elements such as a centerpiece for the table, a defining rug, and a sideboard for storage. Additional preferences include a mirror to enhance light and space perception and potted plants to introduce natural elements.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key substructures: the Central Dining Area, which is the focal point featuring the dining table and chairs; the Ceiling Area, where the chandelier is suspended to provide ambient lighting; and the Wall Areas, which are utilized for additional elements like the sideboard and mirror. Each substructure serves to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal, with the Central Dining Area being the primary focus for dining activities.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Central Dining Area, a glass-topped round dining table (1.5m x 1.5m x 0.75m) and four white high-back chairs (each 0.879m x 0.672m x 0.774m) are recommended to create an elegant and balanced setting. A crystal chandelier (0.7m x 0.7m x 1.0m) is suggested for the Ceiling Area to provide lighting and serve as a visual focal point. A classic wool rug (2.0m x 2.0m) is proposed to define the dining space, while a modern glass centerpiece (0.13m x 0.13m x 0.261m) adds decorative appeal. For storage, an elegant white sideboard (1.5m x 0.4m x 0.8m) is recommended against the east wall, complemented by a classic silver mirror (1.2m x 0.05m x 0.8m) on the south wall to reflect light and enhance the room's spaciousness.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dining table is placed centrally in the room, serving as the focal point of the dining space. Its round shape and glass material align with the user's vision of elegance, and its central placement allows for symmetry and balance, facilitating movement and interaction. The table faces the north wall, adhering to design principles and user preferences.

Chair 1 is positioned to the right of the dining table, facing the west wall. This placement complements the table's round shape and ensures an unobstructed view upon entry, maintaining the room's elegance and functionality. Chair 2 is placed to the left of the dining table, facing the east wall, achieving symmetry and enhancing the aesthetic appeal. Chair 3 is positioned in front of the dining table, facing the south wall, ensuring practical seating and maintaining the room's elegant appearance. Chair 4 is placed behind the dining table, facing the north wall, completing the circular seating arrangement and ensuring easy access for diners.

The chandelier is suspended directly above the dining table, providing a balanced focal point and enhancing the room's aesthetic with its elegance. Its placement ensures no spatial conflicts and aligns with the user's preference for an overhead chandelier. The rug is centrally placed under the dining table, defining the dining area and adding warmth and cohesion to the space. The centerpiece is placed on the dining table, enhancing the table's elegance and serving as a decorative focal point.

The sideboard is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, providing storage functionality and complementing the room's style. The mirror is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, enhancing the room's brightness and spaciousness by reflecting the chandelier and dining setup.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the placement of the plant next to the sideboard due to insufficient space. The plant was identified as the least important object for the user's preference and room functionality, leading to its removal. This resolution ensured the room maintained its elegant aesthetic without overcrowding, aligning with the user's vision for the dining space.
