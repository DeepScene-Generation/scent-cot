## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a sunroom designed to be a bright and relaxing environment, incorporating natural elements. Essential components include wicker chairs, a small coffee table, and a potted house plant, which are crucial for achieving the desired aesthetic and functionality. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for furniture and decor without causing clutter. The user prefers a cohesive design that highlights the sunroom's purpose, with additional elements like a floor lamp for evening lighting, a decorative rug to define the seating area, and wall art to enhance the room's style.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures based on the user's requirements. The Seating Area is designed for relaxation and social interaction, featuring wicker chairs and a coffee table. The Wicker Chair Set serves as the primary seating arrangement, while the Coffee Table Area provides functionality for placing items. The Plant Display adds visual appeal and greenery, enhancing the room's natural theme. Each substructure is carefully planned to optimize both functionality and aesthetic appeal, ensuring the room remains uncluttered and inviting.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, two natural-style wicker chairs are recommended, each measuring 0.437 meters in length, 0.549 meters in width, and 0.92 meters in height. A small coffee table, ideally 0.8 meters by 0.5 meters, is suggested to complement the chairs. A potted plant with dimensions of 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.6 meters adds greenery and freshness. A modern-style floor lamp, measuring 0.601 meters by 0.601 meters by 1.902 meters, provides additional lighting. A decorative rug, 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters, defines the seating area, while contemporary canvas wall art, 1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 0.8 meters, enhances the room's visual interest.

## 4. Scene Graph
The first wicker chair is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement captures sunlight effectively, aligning with the user's preference for natural light exposure and maintaining the room's aesthetic and functional purpose as a bright sunroom. The chair's dimensions are 0.437 meters in length, 0.549 meters in width, and 0.92 meters in height, ensuring it fits comfortably within the space.

The second wicker chair is positioned adjacent to the first, also against the south wall and facing the north wall. This arrangement creates a cohesive seating area, enhancing social interaction and maintaining balance and proportion. The chair shares the same dimensions as the first, ensuring symmetry and alignment with the user's vision.

The coffee table, originally intended to be placed centrally between the two chairs, was removed due to spatial conflicts. Its intended placement was to provide a functional surface for items and visually tie the seating area together, but it was deemed less critical than the chairs and plant.

The potted plant is placed on the south wall, to the left of the wicker chairs, facing the room. This placement ensures visibility and aesthetic appeal, complementing the seating area and adding to the overall design and functionality of the room. The plant's dimensions are 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.6 meters.

The floor lamp is positioned on the south wall, between the potted plant and the wicker chairs, facing the north wall. This placement provides lighting to the seating area without obstructing movement or view, ensuring the sunroom remains bright and inviting. The lamp's dimensions are 0.601 meters by 0.601 meters by 1.902 meters.

The decorative rug, initially intended to define the seating area, was removed due to spatial conflicts. Its intended placement was under the coffee table and extending beneath the chairs, adding visual interest and cohesion to the room.

The wall art is placed on the south wall, centered above the potted plant, facing the north wall. This placement enhances the room's aesthetic appeal by adding a splash of color and visual interest, complementing the existing room layout and maintaining the sunroom's bright and natural theme. The wall art's dimensions are 1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 0.8 meters.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to the limited space available for the coffee table and decorative rug. The length of the wicker chairs was insufficient to accommodate the coffee table in front of them, leading to a decision to remove the coffee table and decorative rug. This resolution prioritized the user's preference for a bright sunroom with wicker chairs and a potted house plant, ensuring the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal were maintained.
