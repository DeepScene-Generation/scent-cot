## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a minimalist bathroom characterized by a rectangular white sink, a tall metal faucet, and a light wooden vanity. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, offering ample space for a minimalist layout. The design emphasizes a clean, uncluttered look with ergonomic access and functional use of space. Key elements include the sink and faucet area, which must be minimalist and ergonomic, and the vanity area, which should provide storage while maintaining the minimalist style. The open floor space is crucial for easy cleaning, and additional items like a wall-mounted towel rack and a simple mirror enhance functionality without cluttering. Lighting is essential, with a skylight mentioned, and a recessed ceiling light recommended for even illumination.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The bathroom is divided into several functional substructures based on user requirements. The Sink and Faucet Area is designated for the rectangular white sink and tall metal faucet, ensuring ergonomic access and minimalist aesthetics. The Vanity Area provides storage with a light wooden vanity, maintaining the minimalist style and offering a warm contrast. The Open Floor Space is crucial for easy cleaning and maintaining an uncluttered aesthetic. The Towel Rack Area enhances functionality without cluttering, while the Mirror Area above the sink serves practical and aesthetic purposes. The Lighting Area, featuring a skylight and recessed ceiling light, ensures even illumination throughout the bathroom.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sink and Faucet Area, a minimalist ceramic white sink (0.656m x 0.491m x 0.932m) and a tall metal faucet (0.05m x 0.05m x 0.4m) are recommended. The Vanity Area includes a light wooden vanity (0.7m x 0.45m x 0.8m) for storage. A minimalist metal towel rack (0.585m x 0.128m x 0.914m) is suggested for the Towel Rack Area. A glass mirror (0.741m x 0.028m x 1.76m) is recommended for the Mirror Area above the sink. For the Lighting Area, a minimalist metal ceiling light (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.1m) is proposed to ensure even lighting.

## 4. Scene Graph
The sink (sink_1) is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, as it is central to the bathroom's function and should be easily accessible. This placement facilitates plumbing connections and aligns with the minimalist style, enhancing the aesthetic balance and functionality of the room. The sink's dimensions (0.656m x 0.491m x 0.932m) ensure it fits comfortably against the wall, maintaining a clean and uncluttered look.

The faucet (faucet_1) is mounted on the sink, facing the north wall, ensuring it is centrally located above the sink for easy access. This placement maximizes functionality for water dispensing and complements the minimalist style of the bathroom. The faucet's dimensions (0.05m x 0.05m x 0.4m) ensure it does not interfere with the sink's use.

The vanity (vanity_1) is placed on the south wall, adjacent to the sink, facing the north wall. This arrangement maintains a minimalist aesthetic and functional layout, providing storage while complementing the white sink with its light wood color. The vanity's dimensions (0.7m x 0.45m x 0.8m) allow it to fit comfortably alongside the sink without overcrowding the space.

The towel rack (towel_rack_1) is wall-mounted on the south wall, left of the sink, facing the room. This placement ensures functional access to towels after handwashing while maintaining the minimalist design. The towel rack's dimensions (0.585m x 0.128m x 0.914m) allow it to fit without overlapping existing objects, preserving balance and aesthetic appeal.

The mirror (mirror_1) is placed on the south wall directly above the sink, facing the north wall. This placement enhances the functionality of the bathroom by providing a reflection area while maintaining aesthetic consistency with the minimalist style. The mirror's dimensions (0.741m x 0.028m x 1.76m) ensure it fits above the sink without interfering with other elements.

The ceiling light (ceiling_light_1) is centrally placed on the ceiling, ensuring even lighting throughout the bathroom. This placement complements the minimalist design and does not interfere with any other objects in the room. The ceiling light's dimensions (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.1m) ensure it provides adequate lighting without dominating the space.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed according to the user's preferences and design principles, ensuring a cohesive and functional minimalist bathroom.
