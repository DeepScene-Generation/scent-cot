## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a serene yoga studio that includes essential elements such as a mirrored wall, a stack of yoga mats, and a shelving unit for storing props and accessories. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters. The design emphasizes an open central area for yoga practice, ensuring a clutter-free environment that supports a calming atmosphere. The mirrored wall is a crucial feature, enhancing the sense of space and light, while the shelving unit is intended to organize yoga props, maintaining a tidy and accessible space.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Mirrored Wall Area on the south wall serves as a focal point, enhancing spatial perception and light. The Central Yoga Practice Area is designated for unobstructed movement, ensuring a sense of openness. The Storage Area along the west wall is intended for organizing yoga props, including blocks, straps, and bolsters, to maintain a tidy environment. The Meditation Area is centrally located, providing a tranquil space for meditation activities.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Mirrored Wall Area, a modern glass mirrored wall measuring 5.0 meters by 0.1 meters by 2.5 meters is recommended to span the entire south wall. In the Central Yoga Practice Area, a minimalist stack of yoga mats (0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.3 meters) is suggested for easy access. The Storage Area features a modern metal shelving unit (1.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 2.0 meters) to hold various yoga props. Additionally, a minimalist meditation cushion (0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.15 meters) is recommended for the Meditation Area to enhance the studio's serene atmosphere.

## 4. Scene Graph
The mirrored wall is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, to serve as a focal point and enhance the sense of space and light. Its dimensions (5.0m x 0.1m x 2.5m) allow it to cover the entire wall, maximizing its reflective capacity and ensuring visibility from any position in the room. This placement aligns with the user's desire for a serene yoga studio and adheres to design principles by enhancing spatial perception and light.

The yoga mat stack is positioned against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures easy access to mats while maintaining the room's openness for yoga practice. The stack's compact size (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.3m) allows it to be discreetly placed without obstructing the mirrored wall's functionality, aligning with the user's preference for a clutter-free environment.

The shelving unit is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, to serve as an accessible storage area for yoga props. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.4m x 2.0m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, maintaining the room's open and serene atmosphere. This placement ensures the shelving unit does not interrupt the reflective surface of the mirror or the space for yoga mats, adhering to design principles by balancing functionality and aesthetics.

The yoga block is placed on the shelving unit, which is positioned against the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement ensures the block is easily accessible for use during yoga practice while maintaining an organized appearance. The block's small size (0.2m x 0.1m x 0.1m) allows it to fit comfortably on a shelf, aligning with the user's preference for a serene and organized space.

The yoga bolster is also placed on the shelving unit on the west wall, facing the east wall. Its dimensions (0.7m x 0.25m x 0.25m) allow it to be stored alongside other yoga props, maintaining a clean and organized studio appearance. This placement ensures the bolster is readily accessible and contributes to the room's functional and aesthetic harmony.

The meditation cushion is placed in the middle of the room, facing the north wall, to create a central yoga area. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.15m) allow it to serve as a focal point for meditation activities, enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal. This placement aligns with the user's vision of a serene and functional yoga studio, utilizing the central space effectively.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified regarding the shelving unit's capacity to hold all intended objects. The shelving unit was too small to accommodate yoga_block_1, yoga_block_2, yoga_strap_1, and yoga_bolster_1 simultaneously. To resolve this, yoga_block_2 and yoga_strap_1 were removed based on their lower functional priority compared to other items. This decision ensures the shelving unit remains organized and accessible, maintaining the room's serene and functional atmosphere.
