## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a functional mudroom that incorporates essential elements such as a wooden bench, a shoe rack, and metal hooks for coats. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design emphasizes both utility and style, with a preference for rustic and industrial materials like wood and metal. The mudroom should facilitate easy storage and retrieval of shoes and coats, while also providing seating for putting on shoes. Additional items such as a console table, mirror, rug, plant, and storage basket are suggested to enhance functionality and complement the room's aesthetic.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The mudroom is divided into several functional substructures. The Seating Area, located along the south wall, is designated for the wooden bench and shoe rack, providing a space for sitting and shoe storage. The Hanging Area on the east wall is intended for metal hooks, offering a convenient spot for hanging coats. The Entryway Area includes a console table near the entrance for holding small items. The Central Area features a rug to define the space and add warmth. Lastly, decorative elements like a plant and storage basket are considered for additional storage and aesthetic enhancement.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a rustic wooden bench (1.5m x 0.5m x 0.45m) and a shoe rack (0.914m x 0.487m x 0.68m) are recommended. The Hanging Area includes industrial-style metal hooks (0.111m x 0.111m x 0.212m) for coats. A modern console table (1.0m x 0.3m x 0.8m) is suggested for the Entryway Area, while a bohemian-style rug (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.01m) is proposed for the Central Area. A decorative plant and a rustic wicker storage basket (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.5m) are also recommended to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden bench is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to maximize floor space and serve as a focal point in the mudroom. Its rustic style and wooden material align with the user's vision, and its placement allows for additional objects like the shoe rack and coat hooks. The shoe rack is positioned adjacent to the bench on the south wall, ensuring it faces the north wall. This placement maintains functional coherence and complements the rustic aesthetic, providing easy access for shoe storage.

Metal hooks are installed on the east wall, facing the west wall, to provide an accessible spot for hanging coats without interfering with the seating and shoe storage. This placement ensures functionality and maintains a balanced aesthetic. The mirror is mounted on the east wall, facing the west wall, to allow for visual checks and enhance the room's functionality. Its modern style complements the console table, adding brightness and a sense of space.

The rug is placed in the middle of the room, serving as a central element that ties together the existing elements and enhances the room's aesthetic appeal. Its multicolor design adds warmth and visual interest. The console table, initially intended for the south wall, was removed due to spatial conflicts. The plant and storage basket, initially considered for placement near the bench, were also removed to resolve conflicts and maintain the room's functionality and aesthetic balance.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to the limited space on the south wall, which could not accommodate all intended objects. The console table's placement conflicted with the shoe rack and bench, while the plant and storage basket could not fit alongside the bench. To resolve these conflicts, the console table, plant, and storage basket were removed, prioritizing the user's preference for a functional mudroom with essential elements like the wooden bench, shoe rack, and metal hooks. This resolution ensures the room remains functional and aesthetically pleasing, adhering to the user's requirements.
