## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a luxurious hotel lobby that emphasizes comfort and elegance. The primary elements include plush velvet sofas, marble coffee tables, and a grand piano, all contributing to a sophisticated ambiance. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, is designed to offer comfortable seating, surfaces for beverages, and a focal point for live music. The user desires an open space that allows for free movement and engagement in various activities, complemented by decorative lighting, a plant for natural aesthetics, and a rug to define the seating area.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key substructures based on the user's requirements. The Seating Area is defined by the placement of plush velvet sofas along the south and north walls, encouraging social interaction. The Coffee Table Area is centrally located between the sofas, providing surfaces for beverages. The Piano Performance Area is a focal point, featuring a grand piano against the south wall. The Open Space ensures unobstructed pathways for guest movement. Additional elements like decorative lighting, a plant, and a rug enhance the ambiance and define the seating area.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, two luxury velvet sofas, each measuring 2.0 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.8 meters, are recommended. The Coffee Table Area features two elegant marble coffee tables, each 1.2 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.45 meters, complementing the sofas. The Piano Performance Area includes a classic black grand piano, measuring 1.5 meters by 2.0 meters by 1.0 meters. Decorative lighting, a modern gold fixture, is suggested for ambient lighting. A natural green plant in a ceramic pot, measuring 0.7 meters by 0.7 meters by 1.5 meters, and an oriental wool rug, 3.0 meters by 2.0 meters, are recommended to enhance the room's aesthetics.

## 4. Scene Graph
The first object, 'sofa_1', is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement maximizes space and creates a welcoming seating area, aligning with the user's preference for plush velvet. The dimensions of the sofa (2.0m x 0.9m x 0.8m) ensure it does not obstruct the room's flow. 'Sofa_2' is placed opposite 'sofa_1' against the north wall, maintaining symmetry and balance. This arrangement allows guests to sit facing each other, enhancing social interaction.

The first coffee table, 'coffee_table_1', is placed in front of 'sofa_2', ensuring accessibility from both sofas. Its elegant marble design aligns with the luxury theme, and its dimensions (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.45m) fit well within the central space. 'Coffee_table_2' is placed to the right of 'coffee_table_1', maintaining a cohesive seating area and providing additional surface space.

The grand piano, 'grand_piano_1', is positioned against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement provides optimal acoustic performance and visual prominence, enhancing the luxurious atmosphere. The piano's dimensions (1.5m x 2.0m x 1.0m) ensure it does not interfere with the room's flow.

'Decorative_lighting_1' is centrally placed on the ceiling, providing ambient lighting without obstructing the room's functionality. Its modern design complements the elegant theme. The plant, 'plant_1', is placed against the east wall, adding natural aesthetics without hindering movement. Finally, 'rug_1' is placed under both coffee tables, defining the seating area and adding warmth and texture to the space.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with 'coffee_table_1' initially placed behind 'sofa_2', which would have positioned it out of bounds. To resolve this, 'coffee_table_1' was repositioned in front of 'sofa_2', ensuring it remains within the room's boundaries and maintains functionality. This adjustment preserves the room's aesthetic balance and functionality, ensuring a luxurious and welcoming environment.

For plant_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with east_wall
        - calculation:
            - Rotation of plant_1: 270.0°
            - Rotation of east_wall: 270.0°
            - Rotation difference: |270.0 - 270.0| = 0.0°
        - conclusion: Using length dimension for directional constraint
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'on' relation
        - calculation:
            - plant_1 size: 0.7 (length)
            - Cluster size (on east_wall): 0.0
            - Total constraint: 0.7 (plant_1 length) + 0.0 = 0.7
        - conclusion: Cluster constraint (x_neg): 0.7
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'east_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - plant_1 size: length=0.7, width=0.7, height=1.5
            - Room size: 5.0x5.0x3.0
            - x_min = 5.0 - 0.7/2 = 4.65
            - x_max = 5.0 - 0.7/2 = 4.65
            - y_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 0.7/2 = 0.35
            - y_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 0.7/2 = 4.65
            - z_min = z_max = 1.5/2 = 0.75
        - conclusion: Possible position: (4.65, 4.65, 0.35, 4.65, 0.75, 0.75)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(4.65-4.65), y(0.35-4.65)
            - Final coordinates: x=4.65, y=4.294870778082905, z=0.75
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 4.65, y: 4.294870778082905, z: 0.75
    5. reason: Collision check with grand_piano_1
        - calculation:
            - No collision with grand_piano_1
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Final coordinates: x=4.65, y=4.294870778082905, z=0.75
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 4.65, y: 4.294870778082905, z: 0.75
