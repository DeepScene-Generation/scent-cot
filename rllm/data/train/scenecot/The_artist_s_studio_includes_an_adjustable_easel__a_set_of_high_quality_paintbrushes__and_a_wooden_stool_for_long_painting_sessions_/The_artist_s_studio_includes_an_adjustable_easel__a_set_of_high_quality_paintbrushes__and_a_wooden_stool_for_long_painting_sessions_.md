## 1. Requirement Analysis
The artist's studio is envisioned as a creative sanctuary, emphasizing painting activities in a space that fosters both creativity and solitude. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, offering ample space for an inspiring workspace. The user specifies essential items such as an adjustable easel, high-quality paintbrushes, and a wooden stool, which are crucial for the painting process. The studio should integrate these items with additional elements to create a harmonious and functional environment, focusing on comfort, accessibility, and optimal lighting.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The studio is divided into three main substructures: the central painting zone, the art tool storage area, and the easel setup zone. The central painting zone is designed for comfort and accessibility, featuring a wooden stool and a small side table for painting materials. The art tool storage area includes a storage cabinet or cart to organize paintbrushes and supplies, ensuring easy access and a clutter-free environment. The easel setup zone requires an adjustable easel positioned for ergonomic use and good lighting, complemented by a floor lamp and a rug to define the area.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central painting zone, a rustic wooden stool and a small side table are recommended to ensure comfort and accessibility. The art tool storage area benefits from a modern metal storage cart to organize supplies efficiently. In the easel setup zone, an adjustable easel is essential, along with a floor lamp for additional lighting and a rug to define the space. Additional objects like a large canvas, a paint palette, and a small plant are suggested to enhance the ambiance and functionality of the studio.

## 4. Scene Graph
The easel, a fundamental component for holding the canvas, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This location provides stability and optimal lighting, allowing the artist to have a clear view of the studio. The easel's dimensions are 0.7 meters by 0.7 meters with a height of 2.0 meters, fitting well against the wall without occupying excessive floor space. The placement ensures no spatial conflicts and aligns with the user's input for an artist's studio setup.

The wooden stool, intended for long painting sessions, is positioned directly in front of the easel, facing the north wall. This placement ensures comfort and accessibility for the artist, allowing ease of access to the canvas. The stool's dimensions are 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters, allowing it to fit comfortably without occupying excessive space. Its dark brown color complements the natural wood of the easel, enhancing the studio's rustic artistic vibe.

The storage cart, designed for storing art tools, is placed to the left of the stool, facing the north wall. This positioning ensures easy access to the cart's contents while maintaining a balanced layout. The cart's dimensions are 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.9 meters, fitting well within the available space without obstructing movement or access to the easel.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to the limited space on the small table, which could not accommodate all intended objects. The small plant was removed as it was deemed less critical compared to the paintbrush set and paint palette, which are essential for the artist's workflow. Additionally, the small table was removed due to its inability to fit alongside the stool, and the large canvas was placed directly on the easel to avoid spatial conflicts. These adjustments ensured the studio remained functional and aligned with the user's preferences for an efficient and aesthetically pleasing workspace.
