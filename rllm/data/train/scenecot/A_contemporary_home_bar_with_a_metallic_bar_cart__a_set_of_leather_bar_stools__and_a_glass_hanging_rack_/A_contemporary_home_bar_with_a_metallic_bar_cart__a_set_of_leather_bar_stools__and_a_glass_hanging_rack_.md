## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a contemporary home bar setup characterized by a modern and minimalist aesthetic. Key components include a metallic bar cart, leather bar stools, and a glass hanging rack. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design emphasizes an open and interactive space, with a focus on functionality and style. Additional elements such as ambient lighting, a rug, and a small side table are considered to enhance the room's ambiance and maintain a cohesive design.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Bar Area is centered around the metallic bar cart, serving as the focal point for storage and serving. The Seating Area is designed for interaction and comfort, featuring leather bar stools. The Display Area includes a glass hanging rack for glassware storage and display. The Lighting Area focuses on ambient lighting to enhance the room's modern aesthetic. Each substructure is strategically placed to optimize space and functionality.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Bar Area, a contemporary metallic bar cart with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.9 meters is recommended. The Seating Area includes a set of contemporary leather bar stools, each measuring 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.0 meters, designed for comfort and ergonomic support. The Display Area features a glass hanging rack, measuring 1.0 meter by 0.3 meters by 0.2 meters, to efficiently store and display glassware. The Lighting Area includes a modern ambient light with dimensions of 0.453 meters by 0.367 meters by 1.5 meters, providing adequate illumination and enhancing the room's ambiance.

## 4. Scene Graph
The bar cart is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, to serve as a focal point for storage and serving. Its metallic and silver design reflects light, complementing the room's contemporary aesthetic. The placement against the north wall maximizes space efficiency and provides a sturdy backdrop, ensuring ample space in front for interaction and accessibility.

The first bar stool is positioned in front of the bar cart, facing the north wall. This placement facilitates interaction with the bar cart and aligns with the contemporary style and material palette. The stool's dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.0m) ensure no spatial conflicts with the bar cart, maintaining a balanced and functional layout.

The second bar stool is placed to the right of the first bar stool, also facing the north wall. This arrangement maintains the user's preference for a set of bar stools and ensures enough space for comfortable seating and movement. The stool's dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.0m) fit well within the room's layout, preserving visual balance and functionality.

The glass hanging rack is installed on the north wall, directly above the bar cart. This placement ensures easy access to glasses while using the bar cart, avoiding spatial conflicts with the stools. The rack's dimensions (1.0m x 0.3m x 0.2m) complement the bar setup, enhancing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The ambient light is placed in the middle of the room, facing the south wall. Its modern style and height (1.5m) allow it to effectively illuminate the area around the bar cart and stools, improving visibility and ambiance without obstructing movement.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts were identified with the side table and the rug. The side table's placement to the right of bar_stool_2 was deemed unnecessary due to space constraints and its lower priority compared to the bar cart and stools. Consequently, the side table was removed. Additionally, the rug's placement in front of the bar cart conflicted with the bar stools' arrangement. Given the user's preference for a contemporary home bar with a metallic bar cart, leather bar stools, and a glass hanging rack, the rug was also removed to maintain the room's functionality and aesthetic coherence.
