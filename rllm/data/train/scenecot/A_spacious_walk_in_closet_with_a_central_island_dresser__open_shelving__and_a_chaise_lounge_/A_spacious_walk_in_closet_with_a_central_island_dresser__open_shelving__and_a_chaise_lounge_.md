## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a spacious walk-in closet with a central island dresser, open shelving, and a chaise lounge. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes the need for a luxurious and functional space that includes a central island for organizing jewelry and accessories, open shelving for clothes and shoes, and a chaise lounge for relaxation. Additional elements such as a full-length mirror for outfit selection, storage boxes for small items, and a side table for convenience are also desired. The overall aesthetic should be modern and luxurious, with a focus on maintaining a spacious and organized environment.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Central Island Area is designated for the island dresser, serving as the focal point for organizing accessories. The Shelving Area along the north wall is intended for open shelving to store clothes and shoes. The Relaxation Area on the south wall accommodates the chaise lounge, providing a space for comfort and leisure. The Mirror Area on the west wall is for the full-length mirror, facilitating outfit selection. Additionally, the Storage Area includes storage boxes on the island dresser, and the Side Table Area next to the chaise lounge enhances convenience.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Central Island Area, a modern island dresser with dimensions of 1.5 meters by 1.0 meters by 0.9 meters is recommended to organize jewelry and accessories. The Shelving Area features open wooden shelving, although it was ultimately removed due to spatial constraints. The Relaxation Area includes a luxurious cream-colored chaise lounge measuring 1.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.7 meters. The Mirror Area is equipped with a modern full-length mirror (0.694 meters by 0.089 meters by 1.544 meters) for outfit selection. Storage boxes in a contemporary style are placed on the island dresser for organizing small items. A modern dark brown side table (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.6 meters) is recommended next to the chaise lounge for holding items.

## 4. Scene Graph
The island dresser is placed centrally in the room, as requested by the user, to serve as the focal point for organizing jewelry and accessories. Its dimensions (1.5m x 1.0m x 0.9m) allow for ample circulation space around it, ensuring accessibility from all sides. This central placement aligns with the user's vision of a spacious layout and enhances the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal. The dresser faces the north wall, adhering to the functional directive of tables/desks facing north.

The chaise lounge is positioned against the south wall, facing the north wall, to provide a comfortable relaxation spot without disrupting the room's flow. Its dimensions (1.8m x 0.8m x 0.7m) ensure it fits comfortably along the wall, maintaining balance and proportion within the room. This placement respects the user's preference for a spacious closet by keeping the central area free and accessible.

The full-length mirror is placed on the west wall, facing east, to ensure it is functional for outfit selection without interfering with other furniture. Its dimensions (0.694m x 0.089m x 1.544m) allow it to fit seamlessly against the wall, complementing the existing room layout and enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The storage box is placed on top of the island dresser, utilizing vertical space without occupying additional floor area. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.3m x 0.2m) ensure it does not obstruct movement, maintaining the room's spacious feel. This placement aligns with the user's desire for a well-organized closet, providing easy access to small items.

The side table is placed adjacent to the chaise lounge on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.6m) allow it to fit comfortably next to the chaise lounge without spatial conflict. This placement enhances functionality by providing a convenient spot for items while maintaining aesthetic harmony with the room's modern style.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, a conflict was identified: the central area of the room was too small to accommodate all objects, including the shelving unit, rug, and island dresser. To resolve this, the shelving unit was removed based on its lower functional priority compared to the island dresser and chaise lounge. This decision ensured the room remained spacious and aligned with the user's preference for a central island dresser and a luxurious, organized environment.
