## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a functional home office that is spacious and well-lit, featuring a wooden desk, an ergonomic swivel chair, and a whiteboard mounted on the wall. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, is intended to maintain a clean and uncluttered aesthetic. The primary focus is on creating a workspace that supports desk work and computer use, with additional elements like a desk lamp, monitor, filing cabinet, and plant to enhance functionality and aesthetic appeal. The user emphasizes the importance of ergonomic and aesthetic standards, ensuring the room remains both functional and visually pleasing.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into two main functional areas: the Home Office Desk Area and the Whiteboard Area. The Home Office Desk Area is designated for desk work and computer use, featuring essential items like the wooden desk and ergonomic chair. The Whiteboard Area is intended for note-taking and reminders, providing a visual aid for the user. These areas are designed to complement each other, ensuring the room remains organized and efficient while adhering to the user's vision of a functional home office.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Home Office Desk Area, a modern wooden desk (1.8m x 0.8m x 0.75m) and an ergonomic swivel chair (0.6m x 0.6m x 1.0m) are recommended to support desk work and computer use. A contemporary desk lamp (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) and a modern monitor (0.5m x 0.2m x 0.4m) are suggested to enhance task lighting and display functionality. A modern metal filing cabinet (0.4m x 0.5m x 0.7m) is proposed for organization and storage. For the Whiteboard Area, a modern glass whiteboard (1.2m x 0.05m x 0.9m) is recommended for note-taking. A minimalist plant (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) is included to add a touch of nature and improve air quality.

## 4. Scene Graph
The desk, a central piece of the home office setup, is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement provides a professional appearance and a clear view of the room, aligning with the user's vision for a functional workspace. The desk's dimensions (1.8m x 0.8m x 0.75m) fit comfortably in the room, ensuring no spatial conflicts and maintaining balance and proportion.

The ergonomic swivel chair is positioned in front of the desk, facing the north wall. This setup ensures ergonomic seating for desk work, allowing the user to work comfortably without obstructing movement. The chair's dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 1.0m) fit well in front of the desk, maintaining balance and proportion.

The whiteboard is mounted on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures it is in the line of sight of someone seated at the desk, providing easy access for note-taking. The whiteboard's dimensions (1.2m x 0.05m x 0.9m) allow it to fit comfortably on the wall without interfering with other objects.

The desk lamp is placed on the desk, positioned on the north wall. Its small dimensions (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) allow it to fit comfortably without interfering with the desk's functionality. This placement enhances task lighting, aligning with the user's preference for a functional home office setup.

The monitor is centrally placed on the desk, facing the user sitting on the chair. This placement ensures ease of use for computer work, with the monitor's dimensions (0.5m x 0.2m x 0.4m) fitting comfortably on the desk without spatial conflicts.

The filing cabinet is placed to the right of the desk along the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement ensures easy access while seated at the desk, enhancing workflow efficiency. The cabinet's dimensions (0.4m x 0.5m x 0.7m) fit well in the available space, maintaining balance and proportion.

The plant is placed to the left of the desk, facing the north wall. This placement adds aesthetic value and improves air quality without obstructing functional elements. The plant's dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) allow it to fit comfortably in the space, maintaining the room's aesthetic appeal.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed according to the user's requirements and design principles, ensuring a functional and aesthetically pleasing home office setup. The room remains uncluttered, with each object contributing to the overall functionality and visual appeal.
