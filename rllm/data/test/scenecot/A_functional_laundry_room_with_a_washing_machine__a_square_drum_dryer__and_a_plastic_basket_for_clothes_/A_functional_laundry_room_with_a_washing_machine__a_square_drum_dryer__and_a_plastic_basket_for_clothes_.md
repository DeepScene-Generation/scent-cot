## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a functional laundry room that efficiently accommodates a washing machine, a square drum dryer, and a plastic basket for clothes. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters. The primary focus is on creating an organized and efficient layout that facilitates easy washing, drying, and sorting of clothes. Aesthetic preferences include maintaining a clean and visually simple environment, with harmonized colors and materials. The user also requires additional storage for laundry supplies and a setup that supports easy transfer of clothes between washing and drying.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to optimize efficiency and organization. The South Wall Area is designated for the washing machine and dryer, ensuring optimal plumbing and ventilation. The Middle Room Area is reserved for sorting and folding clothes, featuring a plastic basket. The East Wall Area is allocated for storage, with a shelf for laundry supplies. The North Wall Area is intended for air drying, featuring a wall-mounted drying rack. This decomposition ensures each area serves a specific purpose, contributing to the overall functionality of the laundry room.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the South Wall Area, a modern-style washing machine (0.735m x 0.741m x 1.018m) and a square drum dryer (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.85m) are recommended to facilitate efficient laundry processing. The Middle Room Area includes a minimalist plastic basket (0.264m x 0.232m x 0.3m) for sorting clothes. The East Wall Area features a modern metal storage shelf (1.0m x 0.4m x 2.0m) for organizing laundry supplies. The North Wall Area includes a modern metal wall-mounted drying rack (0.8m x 0.2m x 0.15m) for air drying clothes. Additional items include a detergent dispenser (0.25m x 0.25m x 0.4m) placed on the washing machine for easy access.

## 4. Scene Graph
The washing machine is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to align with the user's functional requirement for a laundry room. This placement allows for optimal plumbing and electrical connections, ensuring no spatial conflicts and leaving ample space for other elements. The dryer is placed adjacent to the washing machine on the south wall, also facing the north wall. This setup facilitates easy transfer of clothes from the washer to the dryer, maintaining a functional workflow and a visually cohesive look.

The plastic basket is positioned on the floor in front of the washing machine and dryer, facing the north wall. This placement enhances accessibility and functionality, supporting seamless laundry operations without obstructing access to the appliances. The storage shelf is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall, ensuring it does not block access to the machines and is easily accessible for storing laundry supplies. This placement maintains balance and proportion, enhancing the room's functionality.

The folding table is placed on the south wall, left of the washing machine, facing the north wall. This positioning facilitates a logical workflow, allowing easy transition from washing to drying to folding. The wall-mounted drying rack is installed on the north wall, facing the south wall, at a height of 1.8 meters. This placement ensures optimal functionality without obstructing floor space, maintaining a balanced layout.

The detergent dispenser is placed on top of the washing machine, facing the north wall, for easy accessibility. This placement ensures functional proximity to the washing machine, maintaining an organized and efficient laundry area.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the placement of the step stool, which was intended to be placed left of the storage shelf on the east wall. The width of the storage shelf was too small to accommodate the step stool without causing spatial conflicts. To resolve this, the step stool was removed, as it was deemed less critical compared to the other functional elements in the room. This decision aligns with the user's preference for a functional laundry room with essential items like the washing machine, dryer, and plastic basket.
