## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a chic salon with a focus on a stylist's chair, a large mirror, and a trolley for styling tools. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, is designed to be modern and chic, featuring neutral tones. The salon's layout includes distinct areas for each key element, with an emphasis on client comfort, functionality, and aesthetic appeal. Additional elements like a rug, plant, and waiting area are suggested to enhance the room's overall ambiance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The salon is divided into several functional substructures: the Stylist's Chair Area, which is central for client interaction and comfort; the Mirror Area, enhancing visibility and aesthetics; and the Trolley Area, providing easy access to styling tools. Additional substructures include a Waiting Area for client comfort, a Lighting Area for optimal illumination, and an Aesthetic Enhancement Area featuring a rug and plant to add warmth and nature to the space.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Stylist's Chair Area, a chic white leather chair is recommended for its comfort and style. The Mirror Area features a large modern glass mirror, while the Trolley Area includes a chic black metal trolley. The Waiting Area is equipped with a chic black leather bench. The Lighting Area is enhanced with modern chrome wall lights, and the Aesthetic Enhancement Area includes a modern gray wool rug and a green plastic plant. A minimalist wooden side table and a modern black metal waste bin are also recommended for functionality and style.

## 4. Scene Graph
The stylist's chair, a central piece for client seating, is placed in the middle of the room facing the north wall. Its dimensions are 0.7m x 0.7m x 1.0m, and it is positioned to allow easy access from all sides, aligning with the chic salon vision and ensuring balance and accessibility. The mirror, essential for styling, is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. It measures 1.5m x 0.05m x 1.8m, providing stability and direct visibility for clients seated in the stylist's chair. The trolley, measuring 0.5m x 0.3m x 0.9m, is placed to the right of the stylist's chair, ensuring easy access to tools without obstructing the client's view. Wall lights, each 0.15m x 0.15m x 0.3m, are symmetrically placed on the north wall above the mirror, providing focused illumination. The side table, 0.4m x 0.4m x 0.5m, is positioned to the left of the stylist's chair, offering easy access for personal items. The rug, 2.0m x 1.5m x 0.01m, is placed under the stylist's chair, defining the styling area and adding visual warmth. The plant, 0.5m x 0.5m x 1.2m, is placed against the west wall, adding greenery without obstructing the functional zone. The waiting bench, 1.2m x 0.5m x 0.5m, is placed against the south wall, providing seating without disrupting the stylist's workflow. Finally, the waste bin, 0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m, is placed to the right of the trolley, offering convenient access for waste disposal.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The arrangement of objects ensures a spacious and uncluttered environment, adhering to the user's vision of a chic salon. Each object is placed to maximize functionality and aesthetic appeal, maintaining balance and harmony throughout the room.
