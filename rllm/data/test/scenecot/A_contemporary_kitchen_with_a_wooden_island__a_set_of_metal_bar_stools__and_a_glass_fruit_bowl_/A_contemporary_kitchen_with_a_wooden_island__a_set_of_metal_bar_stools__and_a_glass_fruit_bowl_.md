## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a contemporary kitchen that features a wooden island as the focal point, complemented by a set of metal bar stools and a glass fruit bowl. The kitchen should also include high-tech appliances along the south wall, open shelving on the east wall, and a large window on the north wall to provide natural lighting. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design should optimize both functionality and aesthetic appeal, aligning with the user's preference for a modern and efficient kitchen space.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The kitchen is divided into several key substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Central Island Area is designated for meal preparation and casual dining, serving as the kitchen's focal point. The Seating Area surrounds the island, providing seating with metal bar stools. The Appliance Zone is located along the south wall, housing high-tech cooking appliances. The Storage Area includes open shelving on the east and north walls for easy access to culinary tools and additional storage. The Lighting Area is enhanced by a large window on the north wall, ensuring ample natural light.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Central Island Area, a contemporary wooden island measuring 1.825 meters by 0.804 meters by 0.731 meters is recommended. The Seating Area features a set of four metal bar stools, each measuring 0.579 meters by 0.577 meters by 0.4 meters, to provide seating around the island. In the Appliance Zone, two high-tech appliances, each measuring 1.181 meters by 1.23 meters by 1.181 meters, are placed along the south wall. The Storage Area includes open shelving units on the east and north walls, with dimensions of 2.069 meters by 0.284 meters by 1.923 meters and 1.5 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.0 meters, respectively. A glass fruit bowl, measuring 0.35 meters by 0.35 meters by 0.15 meters, is recommended as a decorative and functional piece for the island.

## 4. Scene Graph
The wooden island is centrally placed in the room, serving as the focal point for meal preparation and casual dining. Its dimensions (1.825m x 0.804m x 0.731m) allow it to be accessible from all sides, ensuring ease of movement and functionality. This central placement aligns with the user's preference for a contemporary kitchen and adheres to design principles by balancing the room layout.

The first metal bar stool is placed to the right of the wooden island, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (0.579m x 0.577m x 0.4m) ensure it fits comfortably adjacent to the island, providing functional seating while maintaining the contemporary aesthetic. The second stool is placed to the left of the island, facing the east wall, maintaining balance and symmetry. The third stool is positioned opposite the island, facing the south wall, completing a U-shape setup. The fourth stool is placed behind the island, facing the north wall, ensuring a complete seating arrangement around the island.

The glass fruit bowl is placed centrally on the wooden island, ensuring it remains a visual highlight and is easily accessible. Its small dimensions (0.35m x 0.35m x 0.15m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing the island's primary function.

The first high-tech appliance is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. Its placement ensures functional accessibility and maintains clear paths in the kitchen. The second appliance is placed adjacent to the first, maintaining a cohesive cooking area and facilitating ease of use.

The open shelving unit on the east wall provides accessible storage, enhancing the kitchen's functionality and aesthetic. Its dimensions (2.069m x 0.284m x 1.923m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall without obstructing movement. The second shelving unit on the north wall complements the first, providing additional storage and maintaining a cohesive design.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the open shelving on the east wall, which was too small to accommodate all intended objects, including the decorative item. To resolve this, the decorative item was removed, as it was deemed less important compared to the functional needs of the kitchen. This decision ensured that the kitchen maintained its contemporary style and functionality without compromising on user preferences.
