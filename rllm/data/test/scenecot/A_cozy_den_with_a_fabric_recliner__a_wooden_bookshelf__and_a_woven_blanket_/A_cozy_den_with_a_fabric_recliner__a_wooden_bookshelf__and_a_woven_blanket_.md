## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a cozy den with specific items such as a fabric recliner, a wooden bookshelf, and a woven blanket. The room is defined by its dimensions of 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user desires a layout that incorporates the south, north, west, and east walls, as well as the middle of the room, to create a warm and inviting atmosphere. The primary functional needs include seating for relaxation, storage for books, and elements that enhance the room's coziness and aesthetic appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional areas based on the user's requirements. The Recliner Area is designated for relaxation, featuring the fabric recliner and a woven blanket. The Bookshelf Area is intended for storage, housing the wooden bookshelf and decorative bookends. The Window Area, which provides natural light, is enhanced with a small indoor plant to add a touch of nature. Lastly, the Open Central Area is kept unobstructed to allow easy movement, defined by a small rug to add warmth and comfort.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Recliner Area, a cozy fabric recliner and a woven blanket are recommended to enhance comfort. A rustic wooden side table and a modern floor lamp are added to increase functionality and provide lighting. In the Bookshelf Area, a classic wooden bookshelf is suggested for storing books, complemented by decorative metal bookends to organize and add visual interest. The Window Area features a small indoor plant in a ceramic pot to bring nature indoors. The Open Central Area is defined by a minimalist wool rug, which adds warmth and delineates the space without obstructing movement.

## 4. Scene Graph
The recliner, a central piece for seating and relaxation, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions are 1.0 meters in length, 0.9 meters in width, and 1.0 meter in height. This placement ensures comfort and usability, allowing the user to look towards the north wall, which may later accommodate the bookshelf or other cozy elements. The recliner's beige fabric complements the cozy theme, and its placement against the wall supports both aesthetic and functional design principles.

The side table, measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters, is placed to the right of the recliner on the south wall, facing the north wall. This positioning ensures easy accessibility from the recliner, maintaining the cozy arrangement and providing a surface for items like books or a cup of tea. The rustic wooden style of the side table aligns with the room's cozy theme, enhancing both functionality and aesthetics.

The floor lamp, with dimensions of 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.8 meters, is positioned to the left of the recliner, facing the north wall. This placement provides adequate lighting for the seating area without interfering with the side table. The modern style of the lamp adds contrast and interest to the room, complementing the cozy and rustic styles while enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The bookshelf, a classic wooden piece measuring 1.2 meters in length, 0.3 meters in width, and 1.8 meters in height, is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement ensures stability and accessibility, providing balance to the room's layout without obstructing the recliner or side table. The bookshelf enhances the room's cozy feel by offering storage for books and small items.

Decorative metal bookends, measuring 0.1 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.2 meters, are placed on the bookshelf against the east wall. They serve to organize books and add a decorative touch without overpowering the bookshelf. This placement enhances the functionality and aesthetic of the room by keeping books organized and adding visual interest.

The indoor plant, in a ceramic pot with dimensions of 0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 0.5 meters, is placed near the east wall, adjacent to the bookshelf. It faces the west wall, adding greenery to the reading area and making it more inviting and cozy. This placement does not interfere with movement space and enhances the room's ambiance by introducing a natural element.

The rug, a minimalist wool piece measuring 2.0 meters by 2.0 meters, is placed in the middle of the room. It defines the space and adds comfort to the floor area without obstructing any existing furniture. The rug's placement allows the recliner, side table, and floor lamp to sit partially on it, anchoring the furniture and enhancing the cozy ambiance the user desires.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the placement of the woven blanket on the recliner, as the area was too small to accommodate both objects. Given the user's preference for a cozy den with a fabric recliner, a wooden bookshelf, and a woven blanket, the decision was made to remove the woven blanket to resolve the conflict. This resolution maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal, ensuring the primary elements of the cozy den are preserved.
