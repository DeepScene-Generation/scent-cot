## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a minimalist bedroom that includes specific objects such as a platform bed, a sleek dresser, and a white ceramic vase. These items are essential for both the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes a minimalist style, which requires open space for movement and natural lighting, enhancing the room's tranquility. Additional elements like a nightstand, table lamp, and floor mirror are considered to enhance functionality and aesthetics without cluttering the space.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to align with the user's minimalist preferences. The Sleeping Area is centered around the platform bed against the south wall. The Storage Area is defined by the sleek dresser on the east wall, which also serves as a display area for the ceramic vase. The Lighting Area includes a nightstand and table lamp adjacent to the bed, providing ambient lighting. The Reflection Area is designated by the floor mirror on the west wall, enhancing the sense of space. Lastly, the Comfort Area is marked by a centrally placed rug, providing warmth and comfort.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sleeping Area, a minimalist platform bed made of natural wood, measuring 2.0 meters by 1.8 meters by 0.3 meters, is recommended. The Storage Area features a sleek white dresser (1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meters) with a white ceramic vase (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.3 meters) on top. The Lighting Area includes a minimalist nightstand (0.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.5 meters) with a silver table lamp (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.4 meters). The Reflection Area is enhanced by a floor mirror (0.5 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.8 meters) on the west wall. The Comfort Area is completed with a beige wool rug (2.0 meters by 1.5 meters) placed in the middle of the room.

## 4. Scene Graph
The platform bed is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, as it is the central element of the minimalist bedroom. This placement maximizes space and maintains a minimalist aesthetic, allowing for easy access and circulation around the room. The bed's dimensions (2.0m x 1.8m x 0.3m) fit well within the room, ensuring balance and proportion.

The sleek dresser is positioned against the east wall, facing the west wall, to complement the platform bed's setup. This placement keeps the dresser accessible without obstructing the room's flow. The dresser's white color contrasts subtly with the bed's natural wood, adding aesthetic interest. The dresser's dimensions (1.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) ensure it fits comfortably along the wall.

The ceramic vase is placed on top of the sleek dresser, enhancing the room's minimalist style. The vase's small size (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.3m) fits comfortably on the dresser, adding a decorative element without clutter. This placement maintains the dresser's functionality for storage.

The nightstand is placed to the left of the platform bed, adjacent to it, facing the north wall. This placement ensures easy access for items while maintaining the room's minimalist aesthetic. The nightstand's dimensions (0.5m x 0.4m x 0.5m) allow it to fit comfortably beside the bed.

The table lamp is placed on the nightstand, facing the north wall, providing light for the bed area. The lamp's size (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.4m) fits well on the nightstand, leaving ample space. This placement ensures the lamp is functional and accessible, aligning with the minimalist aesthetic.

The floor mirror is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement ensures no spatial conflict with existing furniture and aligns with the minimalist aesthetic. The mirror's dimensions (0.5m x 0.05m x 1.8m) allow it to reflect light and enhance the sense of space effectively.

The rug is placed in the middle of the room, centered to allow for comfortable movement across the room. The rug's size (2.0m x 1.5m) ensures it does not interfere with any existing objects and complements the minimalist design with its beige color and wool material, adding warmth and comfort.

## 5. Global Check
There are no conflicts in the room layout, as all objects are placed without overlapping or obstructing each other. The placement of each object aligns with the user's minimalist preferences and design principles, ensuring a harmonious and functional space.
