## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a functional laundry room equipped with essential items such as a washing machine, drying rack, and storage shelves. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes a neutral color scheme and adequate lighting, suggesting a preference for a clean and organized aesthetic. The primary functional needs include laundry processing, air drying, and storage, with a focus on maintaining a balance between functionality and aesthetics.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to optimize the layout. The Laundry Processing Area is designated for the washing machine and folding table, facilitating the washing and sorting of clothes. The Drying Area includes a metal drying rack and a wall-mounted clothesline, providing ample space for air drying garments. The Storage Area is intended for metal shelves to store laundry supplies, ensuring easy access and organization. Finally, the Lighting Area is centered around a ceiling light fixture to provide uniform illumination throughout the room.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Laundry Processing Area, a modern white washing machine is recommended, along with a folding table for sorting clothes. The Drying Area features a metal drying rack and a minimalist metal clothesline, both in neutral colors to complement the room's aesthetic. The Storage Area includes modern metal shelves in white, aligning with the functional theme. A contemporary ceiling light fixture is suggested for the Lighting Area, ensuring the room is well-lit and visually cohesive.

## 4. Scene Graph
The washing machine is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, as it is a critical component of the laundry room. Its dimensions are 0.735 meters in length, 0.741 meters in width, and 1.018 meters in height. This placement ensures stability, easy access, and proper connection to plumbing and electrical outlets, aligning with user expectations and design principles.

The laundry basket is positioned on the south wall, left of the washing machine, facing the north wall. With dimensions of 0.5 meters in length, 0.4 meters in width, and 0.4 meters in height, it is conveniently located for transferring clothes, enhancing the room's functionality and maintaining a cohesive layout.

The drying rack is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, with dimensions of 1.0 meter in length, 0.5 meters in width, and 1.5 meters in height. This location avoids interference with other objects and allows easy access from the folding table, maintaining balance and functionality.

The clothesline is installed on the east wall, facing the west wall, with dimensions of 1.5 meters in length, 0.02 meters in width, and 0.02 meters in height. This placement maximizes drying space without obstructing pathways or other objects, complementing the drying rack's industrial style.

The storage shelves are placed on the north wall, facing the south wall, with dimensions of 1.0 meter in length, 0.3 meters in width, and 2.0 meters in height. This location ensures accessibility and organization without disrupting the workflow, adhering to user preferences for a functional laundry room.

The ceiling light is centrally placed on the ceiling, with dimensions of 0.5 meters in length, 0.5 meters in width, and 0.2 meters in height. This placement provides balanced illumination, enhancing the room's usability and aesthetic while aligning with the contemporary style and color scheme.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited length of the south wall, which could not accommodate all planned objects, including the washing machine, folding table, and two laundry baskets. To resolve this, the folding table and one laundry basket were removed, prioritizing the washing machine and remaining basket based on their higher functional importance and alignment with user preferences. This adjustment ensures the room remains functional and aesthetically pleasing.
