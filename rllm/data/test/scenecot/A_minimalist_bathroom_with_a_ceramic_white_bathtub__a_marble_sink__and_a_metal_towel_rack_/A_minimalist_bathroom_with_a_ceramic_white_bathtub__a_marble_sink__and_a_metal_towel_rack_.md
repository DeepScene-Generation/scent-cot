## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user has expressed a desire for a minimalist bathroom that emphasizes essential items such as a bathtub, sink, and towel rack. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space to accommodate these elements without overcrowding. The user prefers a minimalist aesthetic, focusing on functionality and simplicity, with a ceramic white bathtub, a marble sink, and a metal towel rack as key components. Additional elements like a mirror and a small storage unit are suggested to enhance functionality while maintaining the minimalist design. The overall goal is to keep the room uncluttered, with a total object count not exceeding 11 to ensure the space remains functional and aesthetically pleasing.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures based on the user's requirements. The 'Bathtub Area' is designated for relaxation and minimalism, featuring a ceramic white bathtub. The 'Sink Area' includes a marble sink, providing functionality for handwashing and grooming while adding a touch of luxury. The 'Towel Rack Area' is designed for towel storage, maintaining the minimalist design by reducing visual clutter. Additional areas include a grooming zone with a mirror above the sink and a storage area for bathroom essentials. A central lighting area is also considered to enhance the room's ambiance while adhering to the minimalist theme.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the 'Bathtub Area,' a ceramic white bathtub with dimensions of 1.7 meters by 0.8 meters is recommended, fitting the minimalist aesthetic and providing bathing functionality. In the 'Sink Area,' a marble sink measuring 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.15 meters is proposed, offering necessary functionality and a luxurious touch. The 'Towel Rack Area' features a metal towel rack (0.6 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.2 meters) for essential towel storage. A mirror (0.8 meters by 0.02 meters by 1.0 meter) is suggested above the sink for grooming purposes. A minimalist wooden storage unit (0.6 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.8 meters) is recommended for storing bathroom essentials. Finally, a minimalist metal light fixture (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters) is proposed to provide ambient lighting.

## 4. Scene Graph
The bathtub is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, as it is a key component of the minimalist bathroom. Its dimensions (1.7m x 0.8m x 0.6m) fit well within the 5.0-meter length of the wall, allowing for efficient use of space and ease of plumbing. This placement provides a balanced look and leaves ample room for other elements like the sink and towel rack, aligning with the user's preferences for a minimalist design.

The sink is positioned on the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement complements the bathtub on the north wall, maintaining a harmonious and functional layout. The sink's dimensions (0.6m x 0.4m x 0.15m) ensure it fits comfortably without interfering with the bathtub. The marble material and white color of the sink align with the user's minimalist preference, providing a clean and accessible handwashing area.

The towel rack is mounted on the east wall, facing the west wall. It is centrally located between the bathtub and sink, ensuring functional accessibility and maintaining a minimalist aesthetic. The towel rack's dimensions (0.6m x 0.1m x 0.2m) allow it to be easily mounted without conflicting with existing objects, providing essential towel storage.

The mirror is placed on the west wall, directly above the sink, facing the east wall. This placement aligns with both functionality and design principles, creating a cohesive and practical bathroom layout. The mirror's dimensions (0.8m x 0.02m x 1.0m) ensure it fits comfortably above the sink, enhancing the grooming functionality of the sink area.

The storage unit is placed on the west wall to the right of the sink, facing the east wall. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.4m x 0.8m) ensure it does not obstruct the sink area while maintaining accessibility. This placement aligns with user preferences for a minimalist style and offers functional storage convenience without spatial conflicts.

The light fixture is centrally placed on the ceiling, facing downward. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m) ensure it does not interfere with any other objects, providing even lighting throughout the space. This placement enhances the room's functionality and maintains its minimalist aesthetic, ensuring the entire bathroom is well-lit.

## 5. Global Check
There are no conflicts identified in the current layout. The placement of each object has been carefully considered to ensure there are no spatial conflicts, maintaining the user's preference for a minimalist and functional bathroom. The design principles of balance and proportion are adhered to, ensuring each element has its distinct space while contributing to the overall aesthetic.
