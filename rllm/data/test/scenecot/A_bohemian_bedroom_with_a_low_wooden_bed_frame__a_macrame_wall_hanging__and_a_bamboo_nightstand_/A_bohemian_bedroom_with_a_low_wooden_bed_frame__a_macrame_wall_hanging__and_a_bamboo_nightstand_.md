## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a bohemian-style bedroom that emphasizes natural materials and artistic elements, creating a laid-back and natural vibe. Essential objects include a low wooden bed frame, a macrame wall hanging, and a bamboo nightstand. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for additional objects that align with the bohemian theme. The user also expressed interest in incorporating a floor lamp, a cozy rug, a decorative mirror, a potted plant, and a storage basket to enhance both the functionality and aesthetic of the room.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Bed Area is the central zone for relaxation, featuring the low wooden bed as the focal point. The Nightstand Area is adjacent to the bed, providing easy access to essentials. The Wall Hanging Area is designated for artistic elements like the macrame. The Lighting Area includes the floor lamp to create a warm ambiance. The Rug Area is in the middle of the room, adding comfort and texture. The Mirror Area is positioned to enhance the room's aesthetic and perceived space. The Plant Area introduces natural elements, and the Storage Area is intended for organizing items.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Bed Area, a bohemian-style low wooden bed frame measuring 2.0 meters by 1.8 meters by 0.4 meters is recommended. The Nightstand Area features a bamboo nightstand (0.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.6 meters) for holding items. The Wall Hanging Area includes a macrame wall hanging (1.0 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.5 meters) to enhance the bohemian aesthetic. The Lighting Area is complemented by a bronze floor lamp (0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.7 meters) for ambient lighting. The Rug Area features a multicolor wool rug (2.5 meters by 2.0 meters) for comfort. The Mirror Area includes a decorative mirror (1.0 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.5 meters) to enhance the room's brightness. The Plant Area features a potted plant (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meters) for natural decor. Lastly, a wicker storage basket (0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.5 meters) is suggested for the Storage Area.

## 4. Scene Graph
The low wooden bed is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, serving as the central focal point in the bohemian-themed bedroom. This placement maximizes the room's central space, allowing for an open and inviting environment. The bed's dimensions (2.0m x 1.8m x 0.4m) fit comfortably along the wall, leaving enough space for walking and additional furniture. The bamboo nightstand is placed on the floor to the left of the bed, facing the south wall. This placement ensures convenience and functionality, allowing easy access to items while in bed. The nightstand's dimensions (0.5m x 0.4m x 0.6m) fit comfortably beside the bed without interfering with its placement.

The macrame wall hanging is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. It serves as a decorative focal point, enhancing the bohemian theme without interfering with any existing furniture. The macrame's dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.5m) are suitable for the wall, allowing it to hang without obstruction. The floor lamp is placed on the north wall, to the right of the bed, facing the south wall. This placement ensures it provides ambient lighting to both the bed and the nightstand, enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal. The lamp's dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.7m) complement the room's vertical space, providing balance.

The rug is placed in the middle of the room, contributing to the bohemian style and providing a comfortable area for the user. Its dimensions (2.5m x 2.0m) allow it to fit comfortably in the central area without obstructing the flow or access to other furniture. The mirror is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. This location ensures it complements the existing bohemian decor, enhances the room's brightness through reflection, and provides a functional aspect for dressing. The mirror's dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.5m) fit well on the wall, maintaining a cohesive aesthetic.

The plant is placed on the east wall, near the corner where the east wall meets the north wall. This location allows it to be a visual complement to the mirror on the opposite west wall, creating a balanced aesthetic. The plant's dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) ensure it does not obstruct movement or interfere with the functionality of the room. The lamp is placed on the bamboo nightstand, which is left of the bed, and faces the south wall. This placement ensures the lamp is conveniently accessible for reading or ambient lighting while in bed. The lamp's dimensions (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) fit well on the nightstand, maintaining the bohemian aesthetic.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the placement of the basket, as it could not be positioned to the right of the floor lamp due to the bed's location. Attempts to reposition the basket to the left of the floor lamp were unsuccessful due to space constraints. Ultimately, the basket was deemed the least important for the user's preference and room functionality, leading to its removal. This resolution ensured that the remaining objects maintained the bohemian style and functional layout desired by the user.
