## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a classic study room designed for reading, writing, and contemplation. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a sturdy wooden desk, a green leather chair, and bookcases filled with literature. The user desires a space that balances functionality with aesthetic appeal, emphasizing a classic style. Additional preferences include a central table with a globe, a floor lamp, a decorative rug, and a wall-mounted clock, all contributing to the room's classic theme.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Desk and Chair Area is designated for reading and writing, featuring a wooden desk and a green leather chair. The Bookcase Area is intended for organized storage of literature, enhancing the room's classic ambiance. The Central Study Area includes a round table with a globe, symbolizing geographical interests and providing a space for contemplation. Additional elements like a floor lamp and a decorative rug are considered to enhance the classic style and functionality.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Desk and Chair Area, a classic wooden desk (1.8m x 0.9m x 0.75m) and a green leather chair (0.7m x 0.7m x 1.0m) are recommended. The Bookcase Area features two tall wooden bookcases (each 1.2m x 0.3m x 2.2m) for literature storage. The Central Study Area includes a classic round wooden table (0.9m x 0.9m x 0.75m) with a globe (0.4m diameter, 0.5m height). A classic-style floor lamp (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.7m) and a decorative rug (2.0m x 1.5m) are recommended to enhance the room's ambiance.

## 4. Scene Graph
The desk is a central element of the study, placed against the south wall facing the north wall. This placement allows optimal usage and visibility, adhering to the user's preference for a classic study setup. The desk's dimensions (1.8m x 0.9m x 0.75m) fit comfortably along the south wall, ensuring balance and proportion in the room.

The green leather chair is positioned in front of the desk, facing the south wall. This placement ensures functionality and comfort for reading and writing activities. The chair's dimensions (0.7m x 0.7m x 1.0m) allow it to fit well without obstructing movement around the desk area.

A desk lamp is placed on the desk to provide adequate lighting for study activities. Its small size (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.5m) ensures no spatial conflicts, and its placement aligns with the classic study aesthetic.

The first bookcase is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement provides easy access for storing and retrieving books, contributing to the room's functionality and classic style. The bookcase's dimensions (1.2m x 0.3m x 2.2m) fit well along the wall, maintaining balance and accessibility.

The second bookcase is placed adjacent to the first bookcase on the east wall, creating a cohesive row of bookcases. This arrangement aligns with the user's vision of a classic study filled with literature, enhancing the room's aesthetic and storage functionality.

The round table is centrally placed in the room, providing a focal point for contemplation and holding items. Its dimensions (0.9m x 0.9m x 0.75m) ensure it does not interfere with other furniture, maintaining balance and proportion.

The globe is placed on the round table, adding interest and balance to the central area. Its size (0.4m diameter, 0.5m height) fits well on the table, enhancing the room's classic aesthetic and thematic coherence.

The floor lamp is positioned near the round table, providing ambient lighting for the central study area. Its height (1.7m) ensures it offers overhead lighting without obstruction, complementing the room's classic style.

The decorative rug is placed under the round table, globe, and floor lamp, visually unifying the central study area. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m) ensure it enhances the room's aesthetic without causing congestion.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the placement of the bookcases along the east wall, as the wall's length was insufficient to accommodate all three bookcases. To resolve this, bookcase_3 was removed, as it was deemed the least critical to the user's preference for a classic study with a row of bookcases. This adjustment maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal, ensuring the remaining bookcases fulfill the user's vision.
