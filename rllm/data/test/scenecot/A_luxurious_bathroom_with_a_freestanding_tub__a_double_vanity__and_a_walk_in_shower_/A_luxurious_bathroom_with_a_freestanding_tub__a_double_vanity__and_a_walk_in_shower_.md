## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a luxurious bathroom featuring a freestanding tub, a double vanity, and a walk-in shower. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design emphasizes relaxation and luxury, with the freestanding tub centrally located, the double vanity on the north wall, and the walk-in shower on the west wall. Ambient ceiling lighting is intended to enhance the luxurious atmosphere. The user desires a cohesive theme with ergonomic access, proper drainage, and moisture resistance, ensuring the bathroom is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The bathroom is divided into several key substructures to meet the user's requirements. The central area is designated for the freestanding tub, serving as the focal point of the room. The north wall is allocated for the double vanity, providing a grooming space. The west wall is reserved for the walk-in shower, ensuring a functional showering area. Ceiling lighting is planned to enhance the ambiance, while additional elements like storage solutions and seating are considered to complement the luxurious theme.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central area, a luxurious ceramic freestanding tub measuring 1.8 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.6 meters is recommended. The north wall features a marble double vanity with dimensions of 1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.9 meters. The walk-in shower on the west wall is made of modern glass, measuring 1.2 meters by 1.0 meters by 2.2 meters. A modern metal ceiling light, measuring 0.161 meters by 0.161 meters by 0.776 meters, is suggested for ambient lighting. Additional recommendations include a silver glass mirror (1.5 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.8 meters) above the vanity, a chrome metal towel rack (0.585 meters by 0.128 meters by 0.914 meters) near the shower, a white wood storage cabinet (0.8 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.2 meters) on the north wall, a beige cotton bath mat (0.8 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.02 meters) in front of the tub, a chrome metal shower head (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.15 meters) in the shower, and a clear glass soap dispenser (0.1 meters by 0.1 meters by 0.2 meters) on the vanity.

## 4. Scene Graph
The freestanding tub is placed in the middle of the room, serving as the central feature of the luxurious bathroom. Its placement maximizes visual impact and functionality, allowing access from all sides. The tub's dimensions (1.8m x 0.9m x 0.6m) fit well within the room's size, and its orientation does not require alignment with any wall due to its freestanding nature.

The double vanity is positioned against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures balance and functionality, allowing easy access without obstructing the tub. The vanity's dimensions (1.5m x 0.5m x 0.9m) fit well along the wall, maintaining an open flow and highlighting the luxurious features of both the vanity and tub.

The walk-in shower is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This location ensures accessibility and visual integration without obstructing movement. The shower's dimensions (1.2m x 1.0m x 2.2m) fit well within the room, and its transparent glass complements the open feel of the space.

The ceiling light is installed directly above the freestanding tub, ensuring even lighting throughout the space. Its modern style and silver color enhance the luxurious aesthetic, and its modest size (0.161m x 0.161m x 0.776m) integrates seamlessly with the ceiling.

The mirror is mounted above the double vanity on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.1m x 0.8m) match the vanity's length, providing functionality for grooming and enhancing the vanity area's aesthetic.

The towel rack is placed on the east wall, adjacent to the walk-in shower, facing the west wall. This placement ensures easy access from the shower and maintains a clean and functional layout. The rack's dimensions (0.585m x 0.128m x 0.914m) fit well within the space.

The storage cabinet is positioned against the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.4m x 1.2m) complement the existing design elements, providing functional storage while maintaining the room's open and luxurious aesthetic.

The bath mat is placed on the floor in front of the freestanding tub, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.5m x 0.02m) ensure no overlap with other objects, enhancing comfort and preventing slipping.

The shower head is mounted on the east wall, facing the west wall, within the walk-in shower area. Its placement ensures optimal water flow and complements the modern design of the bathroom.

The soap dispenser is placed on the double vanity, facing the north wall. Its small size (0.1m x 0.1m x 0.2m) ensures it does not obstruct any functional areas, maintaining the aesthetic balance of the vanity area.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed considering the room's dimensions and the user's luxurious design preferences, ensuring a harmonious and functional layout.
