## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a contemporary living room that combines functionality with aesthetic appeal, featuring a modular sectional sofa and a sleek TV stand. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary focus is on creating a space that facilitates social interaction and media viewing, with an emphasis on maintaining an open and airy ambiance. Additional elements such as a coffee table, area rug, side tables, floor lamps, and decorative items are considered to enhance the room's functionality and contemporary style.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main substructures: the Seating Area, the Media Area, and the Central Open Area. The Seating Area, located along the south wall, is designed to accommodate the modular sectional sofa, promoting social interaction. The Media Area, positioned against the north wall, is intended for the TV stand, ensuring ergonomic viewing. The Central Open Area is crucial for maintaining an unobstructed space for movement and flexibility, contributing to the room's airy feel.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a contemporary modular sectional sofa in grey fabric is recommended, measuring 3.0 meters in length, 1.0 meter in width, and 0.9 meters in height. The Media Area features a sleek, black wooden TV stand with dimensions of 1.8 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters. In the Central Open Area, a transparent glass coffee table (1.2 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters) and a modern wool area rug (2.5 meters by 2.0 meters) are suggested to enhance comfort and aesthetics. Additional elements include a decorative vase and wall art to add visual interest and complement the contemporary style.

## 4. Scene Graph
The modular sectional sofa is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to maximize space and provide a comfortable seating arrangement. This placement aligns with the user's contemporary vision and maintains an open central space for movement and interaction. The sofa's dimensions (3.0m x 1.0m x 0.9m) fit well along the south wall, ensuring balance and proportion within the room.

The TV stand is positioned against the north wall, directly opposite the modular sofa, to create a cohesive and functional media setup. This placement ensures a balanced look and maximizes the room's functionality for media viewing. The TV stand's dimensions (1.8m x 0.5m x 0.5m) complement the modular sofa, adhering to the contemporary style.

The coffee table is centrally placed in the room, directly in front of the modular sofa, ensuring it is within reach for anyone seated. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.4m) fit comfortably without obstructing movement, and its glass material aligns with the contemporary aesthetic.

The area rug is placed under the coffee table, visually anchoring the seating area and providing a soft surface underfoot. Its size (2.5m x 2.0m) fits comfortably without overlapping the sofa, enhancing the room's aesthetic and comfort.

The wall art is mounted on the south wall above the modular sofa, adding a modern, multi-colored element to the space. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.7m) allow it to be prominently displayed without spatial conflicts, enhancing the room's visual appeal.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the length of the south wall being too small to accommodate all intended objects, including side tables and a floor lamp. To resolve this, side_table_2 was removed, as it was deemed less critical to the user's preference for a contemporary living room with a modular sectional sofa and a sleek TV stand. This adjustment ensures the room maintains its intended functionality and aesthetic appeal.
