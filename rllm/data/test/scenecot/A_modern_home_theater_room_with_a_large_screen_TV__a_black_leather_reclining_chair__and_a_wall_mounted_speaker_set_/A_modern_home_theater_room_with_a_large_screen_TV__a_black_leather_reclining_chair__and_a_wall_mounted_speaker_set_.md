## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern home theater room featuring a large screen TV, a black leather reclining chair, and a wall-mounted speaker set. The room is designed to function as a comfortable and immersive entertainment space, with a media console for storage and control. The user emphasizes a modern aesthetic, seeking a cohesive and stylish setup that enhances the theater experience. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for the desired elements.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into four main substructures to optimize the home theater experience: the Reclining Chair Area, the Wall-Mounted Speaker Setup, the TV Screen Area, and the Media Console and Storage Area. The Reclining Chair Area is designed for comfort and optimal viewing, while the Wall-Mounted Speaker Setup ensures immersive sound distribution. The TV Screen Area is central to the viewing experience, and the Media Console and Storage Area provides organization for media devices and accessories. Additional elements like a coffee table, ambient lighting, and a rug are considered to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Reclining Chair Area, a modern black leather reclining chair is recommended for ergonomic support and style. The Wall-Mounted Speaker Setup includes a cohesive set of speakers to distribute sound evenly. A large screen TV is essential for the TV Screen Area, providing optimal viewing. The Media Console and Storage Area benefits from a modern console table for organizing media devices. Additional recommendations include a small coffee table for convenience, ambient lighting fixtures for atmosphere, and a rug to improve acoustics and add comfort.

## 4. Scene Graph
The reclining chair is placed centrally in the room, slightly towards the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures a clear view of the TV, which is mounted on the north wall, and provides adequate space for reclining. The chair's dimensions are 0.815 meters in length, 0.807 meters in width, and 0.781 meters in height, fitting comfortably in the designated area without blocking pathways.

The TV is mounted on the north wall, facing south, to ensure optimal viewing from the reclining chair. Its dimensions are 1.5 meters in length, 0.1 meters in width, and 0.9 meters in height. This placement maintains a modern and sleek aesthetic, preventing floor obstruction and aligning with the user's preferences.

The speaker set is wall-mounted on the north wall, to the left of the TV, facing the south wall. This positioning ensures optimal sound distribution towards the seating area. The speaker set's compact size, measuring 0.6 meters in length, 0.275 meters in width, and 0.246 meters in height, allows it to fit comfortably without obstructing other elements.

The console table is placed on the north wall directly beneath the TV, facing the south wall. This placement ensures easy access to media devices and maintains a clean and organized look. The console table's modern style and dark wood color complement the room's aesthetic, aligning with the user's vision.

The coffee table is placed in front of the reclining chair, facing the north wall. It is centrally located in relation to the chair, providing a convenient surface for items. The coffee table's dimensions are 0.8 meters in length, 0.8 meters in width, and 0.4 meters in height, fitting comfortably in the available space without obstructing the TV view.

The rug is placed on the floor in the middle of the room, under the coffee table and in front of the reclining chair. Its dimensions are 2.0 meters in length, 1.5 meters in width, and 0.01 meters in height. This placement enhances comfort and acoustics, complementing the modern style and centering the seating area aesthetically.

The lamp is placed in the south-east corner of the room, facing the north wall. Its height of 1.5 meters allows it to provide ambient lighting without interfering with the viewing experience. The lamp's modern style and black color align with the existing décor, enhancing the room's aesthetic and functionality.

## 5. Global Check
There are no conflicts detected in the room layout. Each object is placed strategically to avoid spatial conflicts, ensuring a cohesive and functional home theater setup. The placement of objects adheres to the user's preferences and design principles, maintaining balance, proportion, and functionality throughout the room.
