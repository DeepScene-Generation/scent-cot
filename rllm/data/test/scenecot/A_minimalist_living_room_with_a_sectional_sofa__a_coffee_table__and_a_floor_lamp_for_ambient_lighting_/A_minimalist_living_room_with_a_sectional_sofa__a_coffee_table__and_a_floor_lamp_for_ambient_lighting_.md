## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a minimalist living room characterized by simplicity, functionality, and a serene, uncluttered aesthetic. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Essential furniture items include a sectional sofa, a coffee table, and a floor lamp, all adhering to a minimalist style. The user also desires a media console for entertainment purposes and a small plant to introduce a natural element without compromising the minimalist theme. The focus is on maintaining an open space that facilitates movement and comfort while ensuring the total number of objects does not exceed 15.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to align with the user's minimalist preferences. The primary substructure is the Seating Area, centered around the sectional sofa against the south wall, serving as a focal point for relaxation and socializing. The Surface Area is defined by the coffee table placed in front of the sofa, providing a central point for placing items. The Lighting Area is enhanced by the floor lamp, positioned to provide ambient lighting. The Entertainment Area is marked by the media console on the north wall, directly facing the sofa. Lastly, the Decorative Area is subtly highlighted by a small plant, adding a touch of nature without disrupting the minimalist theme.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a minimalist-style sectional sofa in gray fabric, measuring 2.5 meters by 1.5 meters by 0.8 meters, is recommended. The Surface Area features a sleek, white wooden coffee table with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters. The Lighting Area includes a black metal floor lamp, 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.7 meters, providing ambient lighting. The Entertainment Area is equipped with a white wooden media console, measuring 1.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.5 meters. Finally, a green plant in a ceramic pot, 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.8 meters, is suggested for the Decorative Area.

## 4. Scene Graph
The sectional sofa is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, as it is the primary seating element in the room. Its dimensions (2.5m x 1.5m x 0.8m) allow it to fit comfortably, optimizing space and providing a solid backdrop. This placement aligns with the minimalist style by maintaining an open and uncluttered layout, offering comfortable seating with a clear view towards the center of the room for interaction with other elements like the coffee table or TV.

The coffee table is positioned in front of the sectional sofa, centrally located to maintain symmetry and balance in the minimalist design. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.4m) fit well in the available space, providing a functional surface area without overcrowding. This placement enhances the aesthetic by offering a focal point and aligns with the user's preference for a minimalist living room.

The floor lamp is placed at the end of the sectional sofa, against the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.7m) ensure it provides ambient lighting for the seating area without obstructing pathways or views. This placement supports the user's vision for a minimalist living room with ambient lighting, maintaining balance and proportion in the room.

The media console is placed on the north wall, directly facing the sectional sofa on the south wall. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.4m x 0.5m) allow it to serve as a central point of focus for entertainment, maintaining the minimalist style and functionality. This positioning ensures the media console is accessible and viewable from the sofa, supporting the room's open and organized layout.

The plant is placed on the south wall, left of the sectional sofa, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.8m) allow it to enhance the room's aesthetic without impeding movement or the functionality of other elements. This position adds to the room's aesthetic and maintains the minimalist style without disrupting the current layout.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The arrangement of the sectional sofa, coffee table, floor lamp, media console, and plant ensures that the room remains open and uncluttered, adhering to the user's minimalist preferences and functional needs. Each object is placed to maintain balance and proportion, ensuring optimal movement and comfort within the space.
