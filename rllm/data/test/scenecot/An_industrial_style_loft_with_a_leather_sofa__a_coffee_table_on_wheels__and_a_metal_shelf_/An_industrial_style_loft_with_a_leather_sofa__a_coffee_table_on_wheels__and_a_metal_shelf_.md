## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions an industrial-style loft characterized by a leather sofa, a coffee table on wheels, and a metal shelf. The room is designed to be open and airy, with natural light streaming in through large industrial windows on the south wall. The primary focus is on creating a functional seating area that includes the leather sofa and potentially an armchair and floor lamp for reading. The coffee table's mobility is emphasized for flexibility during gatherings, and the metal shelf is intended for storage and display. Additional decor such as wall art or a clock is suggested to enhance the industrial aesthetic without cluttering the space. The room's lighting is primarily natural, but a pendant light is recommended for evening illumination. The user prefers a minimalist approach, prioritizing essential items that enhance both functionality and aesthetic appeal, with a total object count not exceeding twelve.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Seating Area is central, featuring the leather sofa and additional seating options like an armchair. The Coffee Table Area is defined by the mobile coffee table, providing a flexible surface for gatherings. The Storage Area is anchored by the metal shelf on the west wall, intended for organizing books and decor. The Lighting Area includes both natural light from the windows and a pendant light for evening use. Finally, the Decorative Area is enhanced by wall art and other industrial-themed decor elements.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a leather sofa and an armchair are recommended to provide comfortable seating. The Coffee Table Area features a metal coffee table on wheels, allowing for easy rearrangement. The Storage Area includes a metal shelf with storage boxes for organizing items and maintaining the industrial aesthetic. The Lighting Area is enhanced by a pendant light, providing overhead illumination. The Decorative Area is completed with industrial-style wall art, adding visual interest and complementing the room's theme.

## 4. Scene Graph
The leather sofa, a central piece in the Seating Area, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement optimizes space and aligns with the user's preference for an industrial-style loft, providing a natural anchor for the room's layout. The sofa's dimensions are 2.2 meters in length, 0.9 meters in width, and 0.8 meters in height, ensuring it fits comfortably without overwhelming the space.

The coffee table, a key element in the Coffee Table Area, is positioned directly in front of the sofa, facing the north wall. Its industrial style and mobility make it a functional centerpiece, with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters. This placement allows for easy access from the seating area and maintains a balanced aesthetic.

The metal shelf, part of the Storage Area, is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall. Its dimensions are 1.012 meters in length, 0.512 meters in width, and 2.0 meters in height. This placement ensures stability and accessibility, complementing the industrial theme and providing ample storage space.

The armchair, an additional seating option, is placed to the right of the sofa, facing the north wall. With dimensions of 0.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.9 meters, it fits comfortably without obstructing pathways, enhancing the seating arrangement and maintaining the room's open flow.

The rug, defining the Coffee Table Area, is placed under the coffee table in the middle of the room. Its dimensions are 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters, and it complements the industrial theme with its gray wool material, adding texture and depth to the space.

The pendant light, part of the Lighting Area, is installed on the ceiling above the coffee table, facing downward. Its industrial style and black metal finish provide balanced lighting and enhance the room's ambiance without interfering with floor objects.

The storage box, a functional addition to the Storage Area, is placed on the metal shelf on the west wall. Its dimensions are 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.3 meters, and it helps organize items while maintaining the room's open feel.

The wall art, enhancing the Decorative Area, is placed on the south wall above the sofa, facing the north wall. Its dimensions are 1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 1.0 meter, adding visual interest and height to the room without causing obstruction.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, a conflict arose with the floor lamp's initial position, which was resolved by repositioning it to the right of the armchair, ensuring it did not interfere with the sofa. Additionally, the shelf was unable to accommodate both the storage box and decorative plant, leading to the removal of the decorative plant to maintain functionality and user preference for an industrial-style loft. The floor lamp was also removed due to space constraints on the south wall, prioritizing the essential elements of the room's design.

        - conclusion: Final position: x: 4.3667, y: 1.3560, z: 2.612
    5. reason: Collision check with coffee_table_1
        - calculation:
            - Overlap detection: 0.0805 ≤ 4.3667 ≤ 4.9195 → No collision
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=4.3667, y=1.3560, z=2.612
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 4.3667, y: 1.3560, z: 2.612
