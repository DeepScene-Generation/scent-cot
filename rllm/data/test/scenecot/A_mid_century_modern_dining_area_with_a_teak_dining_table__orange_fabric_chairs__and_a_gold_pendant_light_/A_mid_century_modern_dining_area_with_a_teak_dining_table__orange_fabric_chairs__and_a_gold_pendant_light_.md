## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a mid-century modern dining area within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary elements requested include a teak dining table, orange fabric chairs, and a gold pendant light, all reflecting the mid-century modern aesthetic. The user emphasizes the need for a harmonious color palette and a balance of textures, incorporating wood, fabric, and metal. Functionally, the dining area should offer comfortable seating, adequate lighting, and easy movement. Additional recommendations include a sideboard for storage, mid-century artwork for aesthetic enhancement, and a rug to define the dining area.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Dining Area is the central zone, featuring the dining table and chairs. The Lighting Area is designated for the pendant light to ensure proper illumination. The Storage Area is along the south wall, where the sideboard is placed for additional storage. The Decorative Area includes the north and south walls, where artwork is displayed to enhance the aesthetic. Lastly, the Rug Area is defined under the dining table and chairs to add texture and delineate the dining space.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Dining Area, a mid-century modern teak dining table (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.75m) is recommended, accompanied by four orange fabric chairs (each 0.368m x 0.406m x 0.837m) to provide seating. The Lighting Area features a gold pendant light (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) to illuminate the dining table. In the Storage Area, a wooden sideboard (1.5m x 0.4m x 0.8m) is suggested for storage needs. The Decorative Area includes two pieces of mid-century modern artwork: one on the north wall (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.7m) and another on the south wall (0.95m x 0.02m x 1.4m). Finally, a neutral wool rug (2.5m x 2.5m) is recommended to define the Rug Area under the dining table and chairs.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dining table, a central piece in the mid-century modern dining area, is placed in the middle of the room, facing the north wall. This central placement maximizes usability and visual appeal, allowing even spacing around it for chairs and movement. The table's natural teak color serves as a warm, neutral base, aligning with the user's aesthetic preferences. The placement ensures balance and proportion, adhering to design principles while providing ample space for dining activities.

Chair 1 is positioned on the right side of the dining table, facing the west wall. This placement ensures functional adjacency to the table and complements the mid-century modern aesthetic. The chair's dimensions allow for comfortable seating without spatial conflicts, maintaining symmetry and accessibility around the table.

Chair 2 is placed to the left of the dining table, facing the east wall. This positioning maintains symmetry and balance, providing seating on both sides of the table. The chair's placement aligns with the user's aesthetic preferences and enhances the functionality of the dining area.

Chair 3 is positioned in front of the dining table, facing the south wall. This placement completes a balanced seating arrangement around the table, ensuring symmetry and functionality. The chair's orange color complements the mid-century modern theme, enhancing the room's aesthetic.

Chair 4 is placed behind the dining table, facing the north wall. This symmetrical placement opposite Chair 3 ensures a balanced dining setup, providing ample seating space while adhering to mid-century modern design principles.

The pendant light is centered above the dining table, hanging from the ceiling. This placement provides optimal lighting for the dining area, maintaining symmetry and balance. The gold color of the light complements the mid-century modern style, enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal.

The sideboard is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This positioning allows for optimal access and maintains the aesthetic and functional integrity of the dining area. The sideboard provides necessary storage without hindering movement around the dining table.

Artwork 1 is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement serves as a decorative focal point, visible from the dining area, and complements the room's mid-century modern style. The artwork's varied tones enhance the aesthetic without causing spatial conflicts.

Artwork 2 is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, above the sideboard. This placement balances the visual weight of the room, distributing decorative elements on opposite walls. The artwork's height ensures it does not interfere with the sideboard, maintaining a clean and balanced design.

The rug is placed under the dining table and chairs, in the middle of the room. This placement defines the dining area, providing texture and enhancing the mid-century modern theme. The rug's neutral color complements the orange chairs and teak table, adhering to design principles of balance and color harmony.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed in a manner that avoids spatial conflicts and aligns with the user's mid-century modern aesthetic preferences. The room's design principles of balance, proportion, and functionality are maintained, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing dining area.
