## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a classic library setting within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters. The primary elements requested include a set of wooden bookcases, a leather reading chair, and a vintage globe, all contributing to a classic ambiance. The user emphasizes the need for extensive book storage, a comfortable reading area, and an inspiring exploration space, complemented by focused lighting to enhance the classic aesthetic.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Bookcase Area is designated along the north wall for extensive book storage. The Reading Area is positioned on the south wall, featuring a leather chair and a side table for a comfortable reading experience. The Exploration Area is defined by the placement of a vintage globe, adding an element of curiosity and classic charm. Additionally, a Lighting Area is established with a chandelier centrally located on the ceiling to provide ambient lighting.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Bookcase Area, classic-style wooden bookcases are recommended, each measuring 2.5 meters in length, 0.4 meters in width, and 2.5 meters in height. The Reading Area includes a classic leather reading chair (0.8m x 0.8m x 1.0m) paired with a wooden side table (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.5m) to enhance the reading experience. The Exploration Area features a vintage globe (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.2m) to inspire exploration. A classic chandelier (1.0m x 1.0m x 0.6m) is recommended for the Lighting Area to provide ambient illumination.

## 4. Scene Graph
The first object placed is bookcase_1, a classic wooden bookcase, which is essential for achieving the desired classic library look. It is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall, to create a focal point and provide stability and aesthetic appeal. The dimensions of the bookcase (2.5m x 0.4m x 2.5m) fit well against the wall, allowing for additional elements on either side if desired. This placement is both aesthetically pleasing and functional for book storage.

The reading chair, a classic leather piece, is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. This positioning provides a comfortable reading area directly opposite the bookcases, enhancing both functionality and aesthetic appeal. The chair's dimensions (0.8m x 0.8m x 1.0m) ensure it fits comfortably without crowding the room, maintaining an open and inviting atmosphere conducive to reading.

Adjacent to the reading chair, the side table is placed to the right, facing the north wall. This placement ensures easy access from the chair, enhancing the reading experience. The side table's dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.5m) allow it to fit comfortably next to the chair without obstructing movement or accessibility, complementing the classic library theme.

The vintage globe is positioned on the south wall, right of the side table, and adjacent to it, facing the north wall. This placement ensures the globe is easily accessible for exploration while adding visual interest and balance to the room. The globe's dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.2m) allow it to fit comfortably without interfering with the seating arrangement or the functionality of the side table and lamp.

The chandelier is centrally placed on the ceiling to provide ambient lighting, hanging at an appropriate height to ensure both functionality and aesthetic integration with the room's classic style. Its dimensions (1.0m x 1.0m x 0.6m) ensure it hangs comfortably without being too low, providing even lighting throughout the room.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to spatial constraints. The lamp_1 was initially placed left of the side_table_1, but this conflicted with the reading_chair_1. To resolve this, the lamp was repositioned to the right of the side table. Additionally, the room's north wall could not accommodate both bookcase_1 and bookcase_2, leading to the deletion of bookcase_2 to maintain the classic library's functionality and aesthetic. The coffee_table_1, lamp_1, and rug_1 were also removed to prevent overcrowding and ensure the room's design remained cohesive and aligned with user preferences.
