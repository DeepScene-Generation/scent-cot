## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user has requested the design of a compact kitchenette that must include a mini-fridge, a microwave, and a sink with a drying rack. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, needs to be both highly functional and aesthetically pleasing. The primary focus is on optimizing storage, meal preparation, and cleaning within the limited space, while maintaining a modern style. The user also emphasizes the importance of lighting and a small countertop for meal preparation, with a preference for a clean and efficient design that does not exceed nine objects.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The scene is divided into several key substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Appliance Area along the south wall is designated for the mini-fridge and microwave, ensuring easy access and functional adjacency. The Cleaning Area, also on the south wall, includes the sink and drying rack, facilitating efficient dishwashing and drying. The Storage Area, positioned left of the mini-fridge, is intended for storing food items and utensils. The Lighting Area is centrally located on the ceiling to provide even illumination throughout the kitchenette. Finally, the Meal Preparation Area is situated in the middle of the room, featuring a countertop for convenient access from all sides.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Appliance Area, a modern-style mini-fridge (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.8m) and a microwave (0.45m x 0.35m x 0.25m) are recommended, both in metal with a sleek design. The Cleaning Area includes a stainless steel sink (0.6m x 0.5m x 0.2m) with an integrated drying rack (0.6m x 0.3m x 0.15m) to enhance functionality. The Storage Area features a modern wooden shelf (0.8m x 0.3m x 1.5m) for organizing kitchen essentials. The Lighting Area is equipped with a modern plastic ceiling light (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.2m) to ensure adequate illumination. For the Meal Preparation Area, a modern laminate countertop (1.0m x 0.6m x 0.9m) is recommended to provide a practical workspace.

## 4. Scene Graph
The mini-fridge is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, as it is a key appliance in the kitchenette. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.8m) allow it to fit comfortably against the wall, maximizing space and maintaining a coherent layout. This placement ensures easy integration with other kitchen elements like the microwave and sink, adhering to user preferences and design principles.

The microwave is positioned on top of the mini-fridge, utilizing vertical space efficiently. This placement ensures proximity to the fridge, aligning with the compact design of a kitchenette. The microwave's dimensions (0.45m x 0.35m x 0.25m) allow it to fit neatly without facing a wall directly, maintaining accessibility and visual cohesion.

The sink is placed next to the mini-fridge on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.5m x 0.2m) fit well in the available space, ensuring accessibility and maintaining a cohesive kitchenette area. This placement aligns with the user's preference for a compact setup, adhering to design principles of proximity and function.

The drying rack is positioned on the sink, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.3m x 0.15m) allow it to fit neatly without obstructing access to other elements. This arrangement enhances the usability of the sink area by providing a designated space for drying dishes, maintaining balance and proportion in the arrangement.

The storage shelf is placed left of the mini-fridge on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.3m x 1.5m) allow it to be placed on the floor without obstructing the view or functionality of other objects. This placement ensures easy access and visual balance with other items in the kitchenette, enhancing functionality while maintaining a modern look.

The ceiling light is installed in the middle of the ceiling to provide general lighting to the kitchenette area. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.2m) ensure it does not occupy floor space, maximizing the usable area without obstruction. This central placement ensures even lighting distribution, enhancing the room's aesthetic by creating a well-lit environment.

The countertop is placed in the middle of the room, oriented to face the north wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.6m x 0.9m) provide a comfortable working surface, allowing for easy access from all sides. This placement ensures it serves its purpose effectively without disrupting the existing setup, providing a central workspace that aligns with the compact kitchenette design.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The arrangement of objects ensures that each element is accessible and functional, maintaining a cohesive and efficient design. The placement of the mini-fridge, microwave, sink, drying rack, storage shelf, ceiling light, and countertop adheres to user preferences and design principles, ensuring a well-organized and aesthetically pleasing kitchenette.
