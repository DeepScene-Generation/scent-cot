## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a modern kitchen that includes essential appliances such as a refrigerator, oven, and sink. The kitchen space measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, allowing for a well-organized layout with defined areas for each appliance. The user specifies the placement of the refrigerator on the north wall, the oven adjacent to it, and the sink counter on the east wall. Additionally, a central kitchen island is desired to serve as both a preparation space and dining area. The user also emphasizes the need for seating at the island, proper lighting fixtures, and storage solutions for kitchen utensils and cookware, all while maintaining a modern aesthetic and ensuring the total number of objects does not exceed twelve.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The kitchen is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Appliance Area is designated for the refrigerator and oven, ensuring efficient workflow and accessibility. The Sink Area is positioned for cleaning and food preparation. The Central Island Area serves as a preparation and dining space, while the Seating Area provides seating for dining and social interaction. The Lighting Area focuses on enhancing the kitchen's aesthetic and functionality with modern pendant lights. Lastly, the Storage Area is intended for organizing kitchen utensils and cookware, ensuring the kitchen remains tidy and functional.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Appliance Area, a modern stainless steel refrigerator (0.9m x 0.7m x 2.0m) and oven (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.9m) are recommended. The Sink Area features a modern ceramic sink counter (2.0m x 0.6m x 0.9m) for cleaning and preparation tasks. In the Central Island Area, a modern wooden kitchen island (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.9m) is proposed, complemented by two modern metal stools (0.386m x 0.43m x 0.807m) in the Seating Area. The Lighting Area includes a modern metal pendant light (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.0m) to illuminate the kitchen island. For the Storage Area, a modern wooden storage cabinet (1.0m x 0.5m x 1.8m) is recommended to store utensils and cookware.

## 4. Scene Graph
The refrigerator is placed against the west wall, facing the east wall, as it is a prominent and functional element in the kitchen. Its dimensions (0.9m x 0.7m x 2.0m) fit well against the wall, ensuring stability and accessibility without obstructing movement. This placement aligns with typical kitchen layouts, allowing for future additions of other appliances or counters along adjacent walls.

The oven is positioned on the west wall, adjacent to the refrigerator, facing the east wall. This placement ensures an efficient kitchen workflow, as the oven is easily accessible and maintains a cohesive aesthetic with the refrigerator. The oven's dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.9m) fit comfortably next to the refrigerator, avoiding spatial conflicts and adhering to modern design principles.

The sink counter is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. This positioning allows for a functional work triangle between the refrigerator, oven, and sink counter, maintaining an open and balanced kitchen space. The sink counter's dimensions (2.0m x 0.6m x 0.9m) fit well on the north wall, ensuring no spatial conflicts with other objects.

The kitchen island is centrally located in the room, providing space for meal preparation and dining. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.9m) allow for adequate space around it for movement and accessibility. This central placement ensures the island is accessible from all sides, optimizing its functionality and enhancing the modern kitchen aesthetic.

Stool 1 is placed on the south side of the kitchen island, facing the north wall. This placement provides seating for meal preparation or dining without obstructing movement around the island. Stool 2 is positioned on the opposite side of the kitchen island, facing the south wall, ensuring symmetry and maintaining clear pathways around the island. Both stools have dimensions of 0.386m x 0.43m x 0.807m.

The pendant light is suspended from the ceiling above the kitchen island, providing central lighting for the room. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.0m) ensure it does not interfere with any floor or wall objects, enhancing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The storage cabinet is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.5m x 1.8m) fit comfortably on the wall, ensuring it is easily accessible for storage while maintaining an open, modern aesthetic. This placement avoids conflicts with existing objects and aligns with modern design principles.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The layout effectively accommodates all objects, ensuring functionality and aesthetic coherence in the modern kitchen. The careful selection and placement of objects prevent overcrowding, adhering to the user's preference for a modern and organized kitchen space.

    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Final coordinates: x=2.0004968177468183, y=3.8505431140199926, z=2.5
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 2.0004968177468183, y: 3.8505431140199926, z: 2.5

For storage_cabinet_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No child objects to calculate rotation difference
        - conclusion: No rotation difference calculation needed
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'south_wall' relation
        - calculation:
            - No directional constraint applied
        - conclusion: No directional constraint applied
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'south_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - storage_cabinet_1 size: length=1.0, width=0.5, height=1.8
            - Room size: 5.0x5.0x3.0
            - x_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 1.0/2 = 0.5
            - x_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 1.0/2 = 4.5
            - y_min = 0 + 0.5/2 = 0.25
            - y_max = 0 + 0.5/2 = 0.25
            - z_min = z_max = 1.8/2 = 0.9
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.5, 4.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0.9, 0.9)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.5-4.5), y(0.25-0.25)
            - Final coordinates: x=2.625876673924542, y=0.25, z=0.9
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 2.625876673924542, y: 0.25, z: 0.9
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Final coordinates: x=2.625876673924542, y=0.25, z=0.9
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 2.625876673924542, y: 0.25, z: 0.9
