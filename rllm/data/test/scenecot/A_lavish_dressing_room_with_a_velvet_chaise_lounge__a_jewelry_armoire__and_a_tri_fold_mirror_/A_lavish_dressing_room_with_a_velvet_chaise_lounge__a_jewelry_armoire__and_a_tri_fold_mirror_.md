## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a lavish dressing room characterized by opulence and luxury, incorporating specific furniture items such as a velvet chaise lounge, a jewelry armoire, and a tri-fold mirror. The room, measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, is designed to include distinct areas for grooming, seating, and jewelry storage. The user emphasizes the importance of a luxurious ambiance, suggesting the inclusion of a chandelier for warm lighting and additional items like a small table or ottoman to enhance functionality and aesthetics. The total number of items should not exceed nine, with a focus on key elements that contribute to the room's opulent theme.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The dressing room is divided into several substructures based on the user's requirements. The Mirror Area is central to grooming, featuring a tri-fold mirror for functionality and aesthetic appeal. The Chaise Lounge Area provides comfortable seating, contributing to the room's opulence with a velvet chaise lounge. The Jewelry Armoire Area is dedicated to organizing and storing jewelry, enhancing the room's luxury. The Lighting Area, featuring a chandelier, ensures the room feels inviting and luxurious. Additional substructures include a Small Table Area for holding items and an Ottoman Area for seating or as a footrest, both enhancing functionality and aesthetic cohesion. A Decorative Rug Area ties the space together, providing a cohesive element that enhances the room's luxurious feel.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Mirror Area, a luxurious gold tri-fold mirror with dimensions of 1.5 meters by 0.1 meters by 1.8 meters is recommended. The Chaise Lounge Area features a deep blue velvet chaise lounge measuring 1.8 meters by 0.7 meters by 0.8 meters. In the Jewelry Armoire Area, an opulent mahogany jewelry armoire with dimensions of 0.9 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.5 meters is proposed. The Lighting Area includes a luxurious crystal chandelier (1.0 meters by 1.0 meters by 0.6 meters) to enhance ambiance. The Ottoman Area features a deep blue velvet ottoman (0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters) for additional seating. A small mahogany table (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters) is recommended for the Small Table Area. Finally, an ivory wool decorative rug (2.5 meters by 2.5 meters) is suggested to unify the room's aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The tri-fold mirror is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to provide an elegant and functional grooming area. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.1m x 1.8m) ensure stability and a clear view for grooming, aligning with the luxurious style of the room. This placement adheres to design principles by ensuring balance and functionality, as it is against the wall and provides a clear view of the room.

The velvet chaise lounge is positioned against the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement allows it to be adjacent to the tri-fold mirror for convenience, enhancing the room's luxurious atmosphere. The chaise lounge's dimensions (1.8m x 0.7m x 0.8m) ensure it does not obstruct movement within the room, maintaining balance and aesthetic harmony.

The jewelry armoire is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This positioning provides balance in the room, complements the luxurious theme, and ensures functionality by situating the armoire near the mirror for easy access. The armoire's dimensions (0.9m x 0.4m x 1.5m) allow it to fit comfortably without overcrowding the space.

The chandelier is centrally placed on the ceiling, ensuring it is positioned in the middle of the room. This placement allows it to illuminate all corners effectively, adding to the room's opulent ambiance without interfering with existing furniture arrangements. The chandelier's dimensions (1.0m x 1.0m x 0.6m) ensure it does not take up much space in terms of width and length but provides balanced lighting.

The ottoman is placed adjacent to the velvet chaise lounge, on the west wall, facing the east wall. This arrangement ensures that the ottoman serves its purpose as a footrest or additional seating while enhancing the overall aesthetic of the dressing room. The ottoman's dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.4m) ensure it does not interfere with the existing objects.

The small table is placed to the left of the velvet chaise lounge, facing the east wall. It is adjacent to the chaise lounge and complements the existing luxurious theme of the room. This positioning is both functional for holding items and aesthetically pleasing, ensuring harmony with the overall room design. The table's dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.5m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing movement.

The decorative rug is placed in the middle of the floor, ensuring it is under the chandelier for a cohesive design statement. Its central placement allows it to serve as a unifying element, tying together the deep blue and mahogany tones throughout the room. The rug's dimensions (2.5m x 2.5m) ensure it does not interfere with the placement of existing objects, as they are positioned along the walls.

## 5. Global Check
There are no conflicts identified in the room layout, as all objects are placed in a manner that respects the user's vision of a lavish dressing room. The placement of each object adheres to design principles, ensuring balance, proportion, and functionality without any spatial conflicts. The room's layout effectively accommodates all recommended items, maintaining an open and luxurious atmosphere.
