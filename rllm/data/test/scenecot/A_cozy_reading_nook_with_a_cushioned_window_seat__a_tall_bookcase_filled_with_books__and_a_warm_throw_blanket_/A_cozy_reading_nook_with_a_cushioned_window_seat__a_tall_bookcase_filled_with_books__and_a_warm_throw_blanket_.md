## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a cozy reading nook within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a cushioned window seat, a tall bookcase filled with books, and a warm throw blanket. The user emphasizes a warm and inviting atmosphere, with functional needs such as accessible book storage and comfortable seating. Additional preferences include a modern reading lamp for adequate lighting, a side table for convenience, and a small rug to add warmth and visual interest, all while maintaining a clutter-free space.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main areas based on the user's requirements: a Bookcase Area for organized book storage, a Window Seat Area for comfortable seating and reading, and an Open Area in the center for movement or light exercises. The Bookcase Area is designed to provide easy access to books, the Window Seat Area focuses on ergonomic comfort and natural lighting, and the Open Area remains unobstructed to promote tranquility and flexibility.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Bookcase Area, a classic-style wooden bookcase measuring 1.2 meters by 0.3 meters by 2.5 meters is recommended to store books efficiently. The Window Seat Area features a contemporary upholstered fabric window seat (1.5 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.5 meters) for comfortable reading. A modern metal reading lamp (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.5 meters) is suggested for lighting, while a bohemian-style woven fabric rug (2.0 meters by 1.5 meters) adds warmth to the Open Area. An eclectic-style navy blue floor cushion (0.7 meters by 0.7 meters by 0.2 meters) provides additional seating.

## 4. Scene Graph
The bookcase is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, to serve as a focal point for the reading nook. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.3m x 2.5m) fit comfortably under the ceiling, and its placement ensures easy access to books while seated. This location supports the bookcase structurally and integrates it into the cozy reading nook theme, adhering to design principles of balance and proportion.

The window seat is positioned on the east wall, facing the west wall, to maximize natural light and provide comfort while reading. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.6m x 0.5m) allow it to complement the bookcase without spatial conflicts. This placement aligns with the user's preference for a cozy reading nook, utilizing natural light effectively and maintaining balance within the room.

The reading lamp is placed on the floor to the right of the window seat, facing the west wall. Its compact size (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.5m) ensures it fits beside the window seat without interfering with other objects. This placement provides necessary lighting for reading, enhancing the usability of the nook while maintaining a cohesive look.

The rug is centrally placed in the middle of the room, with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters, creating a central focal point and emphasizing the coziness of the nook. It does not face any particular wall, aligning with its function as a floor covering, and ensures clear movement paths and a cohesive design.

The floor cushion is placed on the rug in the middle of the room, facing the west wall. Its compact size (0.7m x 0.7m x 0.2m) allows it to provide additional seating without overcrowding the space. This placement enhances the cozy reading nook theme by offering flexible seating arrangements and maintaining aesthetic coherence.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to the limited space around the window seat. The width of the window seat was insufficient to accommodate both the side table and the potted plant, leading to the decision to remove these items to maintain the room's functionality and user preference for a cozy reading nook. Additionally, the throw blanket was removed from the window seat due to spatial constraints, prioritizing the primary elements of the reading nook, such as the cushioned window seat and bookcase, to preserve the room's intended atmosphere.
