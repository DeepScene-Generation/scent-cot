## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a modern living space with specific items, including a TV cabinet, an L-shaped couch, and a rectangular rug. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for arranging these elements to create a harmonious and functional environment. The primary focus is on creating a central TV and seating area to facilitate TV viewing and social interaction. Additional decor elements such as a coffee table, floor lamp, and wall art are recommended to enhance the room's inviting atmosphere and modern appeal. The user prefers a modern aesthetic, emphasizing functionality and aesthetic balance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Entertainment Area is centered around the TV cabinet and flat-screen TV, serving as the focal point for viewing. The Seating Area, featuring the L-shaped couch, is designed for comfort and social interaction. The Rug Area provides a visual anchor and enhances comfort underfoot. The Decor Harmony Zone integrates decor elements like the coffee table, wall art, and decorative plants to create a cohesive environment. The Storage Area includes a modern bookshelf for storing books and decor, contributing to the room's aesthetic balance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Entertainment Area, a modern TV cabinet (1.5m x 0.4m x 0.6m) and a flat-screen TV (1.2m x 0.1m x 0.7m) are recommended. The Seating Area features an L-shaped couch (2.5m x 2.0m x 0.8m) in a modern fabric style. The Rug Area includes a rectangular rug (2.997m x 1.962m x 0.0027m) to enhance comfort and aesthetics. The Decor Harmony Zone is complemented by a modern coffee table (1.0m x 0.5m x 0.4m), wall art (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.8m), and decorative plants (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m). The Storage Area features a modern bookshelf (0.9m x 0.3m x 1.8m) for storing books and decor.

## 4. Scene Graph
The TV cabinet is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, as it serves as the central element of the entertainment area. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.4m x 0.6m) fit well against the wall, providing stability and optimal viewing. This placement allows the L-shaped couch and rug to be positioned facing the TV cabinet, creating a cohesive entertainment area. The flat-screen TV is mounted above the TV cabinet on the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.1m x 0.7m) fit perfectly on the cabinet, ensuring it is at eye level for viewers seated on the couch, maintaining a modern and organized aesthetic.

The L-shaped couch is positioned in the corner formed by the south and west walls, facing the north wall. This placement maximizes space and provides a comfortable viewing angle for the TV. The couch's dimensions (2.5m x 2.0m x 0.8m) fit well against the walls without causing spatial conflicts, enhancing both functionality and aesthetics. The rug is placed in the middle of the room, parallel to the north wall, and in front of the L-shaped couch. Its dimensions (2.997m x 1.962m x 0.0027m) allow it to complement the seating area and provide a soft surface underfoot, enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal.

The wall art is placed on the north wall above the TV cabinet, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.8m) ensure it does not obstruct the TV, adding a modern decor element that enhances the room's aesthetic without disrupting functionality. The bookshelf is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (0.9m x 0.3m x 1.8m) fit well along the wall, providing easy access for adding and removing books, maintaining the room's aesthetic balance. The decorative plant is placed in the south-east corner, adjacent to the south and east walls, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 1.0m) ensure it complements the modern style and enhances the room's aesthetic without causing spatial conflicts.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose with the placement of the floor lamp, initially intended to be left of the L-shaped couch, which would place it out of bounds. The lamp was repositioned to the west wall to avoid spatial conflicts, but this led to a new issue as the west wall could not accommodate all intended objects. Given the user's preference for a modern living space with a TV cabinet, L-shaped couch, and rug, the floor lamp was deemed the least essential and was removed to resolve the conflict. This decision ensured the room maintained its modern aesthetic and functional priorities without overcrowding.
