## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a mid-century modern dining room that includes essential elements such as an oval dining table, chairs with fabric cushions, and a brass pendant light. The room is intended for dining and entertaining, necessitating comfortable seating, adequate lighting, and a harmonious aesthetic. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user emphasizes a preference for a mid-century modern style, which is characterized by clean lines, functional furniture, and a warm, inviting atmosphere.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The central area is designated as the Dining Area, centered around the oval dining table and surrounded by chairs. The Lighting Area is directly above the dining table, where the pendant light will provide warm illumination. The Storage Area is against the south wall, where a sideboard will offer additional storage. The Decor Area includes a rug under the dining table, a wall clock on the north wall, and an art piece on the east wall, all contributing to the room's mid-century modern charm.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Dining Area, a mid-century modern oval dining table made of walnut wood, measuring 2.0 meters by 1.2 meters by 0.75 meters, is recommended. Surrounding the table are four mid-century modern chairs with wood and fabric construction, each measuring 0.7 meters by 0.535 meters by 0.801 meters. The Lighting Area features a brass pendant light with dimensions of 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters, providing ambient lighting. The Storage Area includes a walnut sideboard measuring 1.5 meters by 0.45 meters by 0.8 meters. The Decor Area features a beige wool rug (3.0 meters by 2.0 meters), a black wall clock (0.4 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.4 meters), and a multi-color canvas art piece (1.0 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.7 meters).

## 4. Scene Graph
The dining table is the focal point of the dining room, centrally placed to ensure accessibility and aesthetic appeal. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.2m x 0.75m) fit well in the middle of the room, allowing ample space for chairs and movement around it. This central placement aligns with the user's preference for a mid-century modern style, emphasizing open and airy layouts. The table faces the north wall, adhering to design principles of balance and proportion.

Chair 1 is placed to the right of the dining table, facing the west wall. This placement ensures a balanced and functional dining setup, maintaining aesthetic harmony and ease of movement. Chair 2 is positioned to the left of the dining table, facing the east wall, creating symmetry and ensuring seating availability on both sides of the table. Chair 3 is placed directly in front of the dining table, facing the south wall, completing a balanced seating arrangement. Chair 4 is positioned behind the dining table, facing the north wall, ensuring symmetry and balance.

The pendant light is placed directly above the dining table, hanging from the ceiling, to provide optimal lighting for dining and complement the mid-century modern style. The sideboard is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, ensuring easy access to stored items and maintaining an open dining space. The rug is placed under the dining table and chairs, centered in the middle of the room, defining the dining area and enhancing visual balance. The wall clock is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall, ensuring visibility from the dining table and complementing the room's aesthetic. The art piece is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall, ensuring it is at eye level for maximum visual impact.

## 5. Global Check
There are no conflicts in the room layout, as all objects are placed with consideration of spatial relationships and user preferences. The placement of each object adheres to design principles, ensuring balance, proportion, and functionality within the room.
