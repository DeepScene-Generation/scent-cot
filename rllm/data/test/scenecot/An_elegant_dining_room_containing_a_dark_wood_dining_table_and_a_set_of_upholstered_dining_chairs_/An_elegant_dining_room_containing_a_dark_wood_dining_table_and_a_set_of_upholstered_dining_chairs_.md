## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions an elegant dining room that combines functionality with aesthetic appeal. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for a sophisticated dining setup. The central focus is a dark wood dining table, complemented by upholstered chairs. The user desires additional elements such as a chandelier or pendant light to enhance the ambiance, along with decorative items like a rug, artwork, and a sideboard for storage. The overall goal is to create a cohesive and elegant dining experience that maintains functionality and allows for easy movement within the space.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The Dining Area is the central zone, featuring the dining table and chairs as the focal point. The Lighting Area is designated for the chandelier, providing both illumination and elegance. The Decorative Area includes a rug under the dining table, artwork on the walls, and a vase as a centerpiece, all contributing to the room's aesthetic appeal. The Storage Area is defined by the placement of a sideboard against the north wall, offering practical storage solutions while maintaining the room's elegance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Dining Area, a dark wood dining table measuring 1.6 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended, surrounded by upholstered chairs to enhance comfort and style. The Lighting Area features a crystal chandelier (1.0 meters by 1.0 meters by 0.5 meters) suspended from the ceiling to provide ambient lighting. In the Decorative Area, a wool rug (2.5 meters by 1.5 meters by 0.01 meters) is placed under the dining table, a ceramic vase (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.4 meters) serves as a centerpiece, and a canvas artwork (1.0 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.0 meters) is displayed on the south wall. The Storage Area includes a wooden sideboard (1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.8 meters) against the north wall for storing dining essentials.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dining table, a central element of the room, is placed in the middle to optimize space and accessibility, aligning with the user's preference for an elegant dining room. Its dimensions (1.6m x 0.9m x 0.75m) allow for chairs to be placed around it without crowding the room, ensuring balance and symmetry. The table faces the north wall, providing a focal point that enhances the room's elegance.

Dining chairs are strategically placed around the table to maintain balance and functionality. Dining Chair 1 is positioned in front of the table, facing the south wall, while Dining Chair 2 is behind the table, facing the north wall. Dining Chair 3 is to the left of the table, facing the east wall, and Dining Chair 4 is to the right, facing the west wall. Each chair's dimensions (0.505m x 0.622m x 0.883m) ensure they fit comfortably around the table, adhering to design principles of symmetry and proportion.

The chandelier is centrally positioned above the dining table, suspended from the ceiling. Its placement ensures even lighting across the table, enhancing the room's elegance without interfering with movement. The chandelier's dimensions (1.0m x 1.0m x 0.5m) are suitable for the room's height, making it a prominent feature that complements the dining setup.

The rug is placed directly under the dining table, covering the area occupied by the table and chairs. Its dimensions (2.5m x 1.5m x 0.01m) fit comfortably within the room, enhancing the dining area's elegance and defining the space visually. The rug's dark brown color matches the table, ensuring aesthetic consistency.

The sideboard is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.5m x 0.8m) allow it to fit without obstructing the dining setup, providing storage while maintaining the room's balance and proportion. The sideboard complements the dark wood of the dining table, adding to the room's elegance.

The vase is centrally placed on the dining table, serving as a decorative centerpiece. Its small dimensions (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.4m) ensure it does not obstruct dining activities, enhancing the table's aesthetic without impeding functionality.

The artwork is displayed on the south wall, facing the dining table. Its placement provides a decorative focal point that complements the room's elegance, maintaining balance and proportion without cluttering the space.

The mirror is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.05m x 0.8m) allow it to reflect light from the chandelier and the dining area, enhancing the room's visual appeal and creating an illusion of more space.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, conflicts arose due to the limited space around the dining table, particularly with the placement of additional chairs. The dimensions of the dining table and chairs led to spatial conflicts, necessitating the removal of Dining Chair 5 and Dining Chair 6 to maintain the room's elegance and functionality. By removing these chairs, the room retains its balance and symmetry, aligning with the user's preference for an elegant dining setup. This resolution ensures the dining area remains accessible and comfortable, preserving the room's aesthetic appeal.
