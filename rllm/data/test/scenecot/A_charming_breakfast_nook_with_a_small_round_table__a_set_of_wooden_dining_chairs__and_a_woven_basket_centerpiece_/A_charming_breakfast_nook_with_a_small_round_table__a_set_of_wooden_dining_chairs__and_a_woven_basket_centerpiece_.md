## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a charming breakfast nook characterized by a small round table, wooden dining chairs, and a woven basket centerpiece. The space is enhanced by natural light from an east wall window, creating an inviting atmosphere. The primary elements include the round table as a central gathering point, dining chairs for seating, and the centerpiece for added charm. Additional elements such as a rug, sideboard, and lighting fixture are suggested to improve functionality and aesthetics, while maintaining a cozy and inviting ambiance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The central area is designated for the dining setup, featuring the round table and chairs. A decorative zone is created with the centerpiece on the table. The floor area is defined by a rug, enhancing the cozy atmosphere. A storage area is established with a sideboard against the south wall, providing additional functionality. The ceiling area is utilized for ambient lighting, ensuring the space is well-lit and inviting.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central dining area, a rustic-style round table (1.0m x 1.0m x 0.75m) and four wooden dining chairs (each 0.41m x 0.388m x 0.612m) are recommended. The decorative zone features a bohemian-style woven basket centerpiece (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.2m). A bohemian wool rug (2.0m x 2.0m x 0.02m) defines the floor area. The storage area includes a rustic wooden sideboard (1.2m x 0.4m x 0.8m) for extra storage. A modern metal lighting fixture (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.5m) is suggested for ambient lighting, adding a contemporary contrast to the rustic elements.

## 4. Scene Graph
The round table is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall, as it serves as the focal point for the breakfast nook. Its rustic style and natural wood color align with the user's preference, ensuring accessibility from all sides for seating. The placement in the middle of the room allows for unobstructed arrangement of dining chairs around it, enhancing both functionality and aesthetic appeal.

Chair_1 is positioned to the right of the table, facing the west wall. This placement balances the layout and adheres to typical dining arrangements, ensuring no spatial conflicts and facilitating easy seating. Chair_2 is placed to the left of the table, facing the east wall, maintaining symmetry and enhancing the nook's functionality. Chair_3 is positioned behind the table, facing the north wall, completing a balanced look and ensuring seating on each side of the table. Chair_4 is placed in front of the table, facing the south wall, completing the seating arrangement and ensuring functional and aesthetic harmony.

The centerpiece is placed on the table, centrally located, acting as a focal point and enhancing the aesthetic without causing spatial conflicts. The rug is placed under the table and chairs, defining the dining area and enhancing the room's aesthetic with its earth tones. The sideboard is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, providing storage functionality while complementing the rustic aesthetic. The lighting fixture is suspended from the ceiling, directly above the table, providing ambient lighting and maintaining symmetry in the room.

## 5. Global Check
There are no conflicts detected in the current layout. All objects are placed without spatial conflicts, adhering to user preferences and design principles. The arrangement ensures functional and aesthetic harmony, with each element complementing the overall charm of the breakfast nook.
