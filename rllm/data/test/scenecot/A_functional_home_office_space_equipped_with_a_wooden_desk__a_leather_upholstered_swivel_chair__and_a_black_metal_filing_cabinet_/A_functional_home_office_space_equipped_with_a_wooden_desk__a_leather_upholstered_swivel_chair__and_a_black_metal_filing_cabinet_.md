## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a home office space that prioritizes both functionality and aesthetics, with an emphasis on workspace organization, comfort, and an open area for movement. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user prefers a modern and professional atmosphere, incorporating materials such as wood, leather, and metal. Essential elements include a wooden desk, a black metal filing cabinet, and a leather upholstered swivel chair, with additional recommendations for a desk lamp, monitor, rug, and wall shelves to enhance functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three primary substructures: the Desk and Filing Cabinet Area, the Seating Area, and the Open Area. The Desk and Filing Cabinet Area is dedicated to workspace organization and document management, featuring the desk and filing cabinet. The Seating Area focuses on ergonomic support, centered around the swivel chair. The Open Area is designed to provide unobstructed movement, contributing to a sense of spaciousness and avoiding clutter.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Desk and Filing Cabinet Area, a modern wooden desk (1.5m x 0.8m x 0.75m) and a black metal filing cabinet (0.5m x 0.4m x 1.2m) are recommended to facilitate workspace organization and document storage. The Seating Area includes a leather upholstered swivel chair (0.6m x 0.6m x 1.0m) for ergonomic support. Additional recommendations include a modern metal desk lamp (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) for task lighting, a monitor (0.5m x 0.2m x 0.4m) for increased productivity, a gray fabric rug (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.01m) to define the seating area, and a wooden wall shelf (1.0m x 0.3m x 0.2m) for storage and display.

## 4. Scene Graph
The desk is a central piece for workspace organization, placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.8m x 0.75m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing movement, providing a functional workspace layout. The filing cabinet, essential for document storage, is positioned to the right of the desk, adjacent and facing the north wall. Its compact size (0.5m x 0.4m x 1.2m) ensures it complements the desk's function without overcrowding the space.

The swivel chair is placed in front of the desk, facing the south wall, to facilitate easy access to both the desk and filing cabinet. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 1.0m) allow it to fit comfortably in the middle of the room, ensuring functional seating. The desk lamp, a modern metal piece for task lighting, is placed on the left side of the desk, facing the north wall, to provide adequate lighting without obstructing access to the filing cabinet.

The monitor is placed centrally on the desk, facing the north wall, to optimize the user's viewing experience while seated in the chair. Its size (0.5m x 0.2m x 0.4m) fits comfortably on the desk's surface. The rug is placed under the chair, in front of the desk, and located in the middle of the room. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.01m) allow it to define the seating area effectively, extending slightly beyond the chair to create a cohesive look.

The wall shelf is mounted on the south wall, above the desk, to the left of the filing cabinet. Its size (1.0m x 0.3m x 0.2m) ensures no obstruction to the desk lamp or monitor, enhancing storage options while maintaining aesthetic continuity with the modern design of the room.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited length of the south wall, which could not accommodate all intended objects. The conflict involved the wall shelf, desk, desk lamp, filing cabinet, and chair. To resolve this, wall_shelf_2 was removed, as it was deemed the least critical to the user's preference for a functional home office equipped with a wooden desk, leather swivel chair, and black metal filing cabinet. This resolution maintained the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.
