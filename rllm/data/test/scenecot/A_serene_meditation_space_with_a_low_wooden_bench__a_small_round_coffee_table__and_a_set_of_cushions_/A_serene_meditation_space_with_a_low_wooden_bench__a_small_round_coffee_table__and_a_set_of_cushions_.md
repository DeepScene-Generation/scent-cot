## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a serene meditation space that emphasizes simplicity and tranquility. Key elements include a low wooden bench, a small round coffee table, and a set of cushions. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user prefers natural materials and minimalist designs to maintain an open and inviting atmosphere. Additional elements like a floor lamp and an indoor plant are suggested to enhance the room's ambiance without cluttering it.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional areas based on the user's requirements. The Meditation Bench Area is central to the seating arrangement, with the bench placed against the south wall to minimize distractions. The Coffee Table Area is positioned close to the bench for easy access to meditation tools. The Cushion Arrangement Area provides flexible seating configurations with multiple cushions. Additional elements like a Floor Lamp Area and an Indoor Plant Area are included to enhance the room's serene ambiance.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Meditation Bench Area, a minimalist wooden bench measuring 1.2 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters is recommended. The Coffee Table Area features a small, round table made of light wood, measuring 0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters. The Cushion Arrangement Area includes multiple cushions, each measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.15 meters, made of fabric in earth tones. A floor lamp with a height of 1.5 meters provides ambient lighting, while a small indoor plant in a ceramic pot measuring 0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.7 meters introduces a natural element.

## 4. Scene Graph
The meditation bench is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement utilizes the room's dimensions efficiently and aligns with the user's preference for a serene environment. The bench's minimalist design and natural wood material create a focal point that enhances the room's aesthetic appeal. The coffee table is positioned in the middle of the room, in front of the bench, ensuring easy access to meditation tools. Its light wood color complements the bench, contributing to a cohesive and serene atmosphere.

Cushion 1 is placed in the corner between the south and west walls, facing the north wall. This placement avoids spatial conflicts and maintains the room's open floor space. Cushion 2 is positioned in the middle of the room, behind the coffee table and in front of the bench, ensuring symmetry and functionality. Cushion 3 is placed on the south wall, adjacent to Cushion 1, creating a cohesive seating area around the coffee table.

The floor lamp is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall, providing ambient lighting without obstructing movement. Its minimalist style complements the room's design, enhancing the serene atmosphere. The indoor plant is placed in the corner between the south and east walls, facing the north wall. This placement enhances the room's tranquility and aesthetic without interfering with the meditation area.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the initial placement of Cushion 1, which was positioned behind the meditation bench, leading to an out-of-bounds issue. To resolve this, Cushion 1 was repositioned to the corner between the south and west walls, maintaining the room's open and inviting atmosphere. This adjustment ensures that all objects are placed within the room's boundaries, adhering to the user's preference for a serene and minimalist space.
