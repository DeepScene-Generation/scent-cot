## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a cozy cabin living room characterized by a rustic aesthetic. Key elements include a stone fireplace, a plush brown sofa, and a wooden coffee table, all contributing to a warm and inviting atmosphere. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary focus is on creating a space that feels both comfortable and visually appealing, with an emphasis on rustic charm and functionality.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The south wall is designated for the plush brown sofa, creating a central seating area. The north wall is reserved for the stone fireplace, serving as a focal point and heat source. The middle of the room is allocated for the wooden coffee table, enhancing interaction and accessibility. Additional areas include spaces for ambient lighting, a rug for added warmth, and side tables for functionality, all contributing to the rustic theme.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the seating area, a plush brown sofa is recommended, measuring 2.0 meters by 1.0 meter by 0.8 meters. The stone fireplace, with dimensions of 1.5 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.2 meters, is suggested for the north wall. A wooden coffee table, 1.2 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.4 meters, is proposed for the center of the room. A rustic-style rug (2.5 meters by 1.5 meters) is recommended to enhance warmth. Side tables (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.6 meters) and a rustic bookshelf (1.0 meter by 0.3 meters by 1.8 meters) are suggested to complement the seating area. A floor lamp (0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.6 meters) is recommended for ambient lighting.

## 4. Scene Graph
The stone fireplace is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, to serve as a focal point and heat source. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.6m x 1.2m) fit well against the wall, ensuring it does not encroach on other areas. This placement enhances visibility and functionality, aligning with the cozy cabin theme.

The plush brown sofa is positioned against the south wall, facing the north wall, to create a cozy seating arrangement. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.8m) allow it to fit comfortably, maintaining balance and proportion. This placement ensures a direct line of sight to the fireplace, enhancing the room's inviting atmosphere.

The wooden coffee table is centrally located in front of the sofa, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.4m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing movement. This placement facilitates interaction and complements the rustic style, maintaining a logical flow and balance.

The rustic-style rug is placed under the coffee table, centered in the middle of the room. Its dimensions (2.5m x 1.5m) fit comfortably, enhancing the cozy atmosphere without creating spatial conflicts. This placement supports the rustic style and provides a soft, warm surface.

The side table is placed on the right side of the sofa against the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.6m) allow it to fit comfortably without overcrowding the space. This placement enhances functionality by serving as a surface for items while seated.

The rustic bookshelf is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.3m x 1.8m) fit well along the wall, ensuring stability and efficient use of space. This placement complements the existing rustic theme and provides easy access to books from the seating area.

The floor lamp is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall, positioned right of the side table. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.6m) ensure it does not obstruct movement. This placement enhances the cozy ambiance and provides functional lighting for the seating area.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited length of the south wall, which could not accommodate all intended objects. The objects involved were side_table_2, side_table_1, coffee_table_1, floor_lamp_1, and sofa_1. To resolve this, side_table_2 was removed, as it was deemed the least important for maintaining the user's preference for a cozy cabin living room with a stone fireplace, plush brown sofa, and wooden coffee table. This adjustment ensured the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal were preserved.
