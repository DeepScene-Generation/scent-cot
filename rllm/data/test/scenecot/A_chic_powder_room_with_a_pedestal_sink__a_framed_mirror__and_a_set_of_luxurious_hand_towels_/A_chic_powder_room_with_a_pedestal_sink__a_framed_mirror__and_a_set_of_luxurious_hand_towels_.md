## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a chic powder room that exudes elegance, comfort, and visual harmony. The room is designed to include a pedestal sink, a framed mirror, and luxurious hand towels, all contributing to a sophisticated ambiance. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space to achieve the desired aesthetic and functional usability. The focus is on creating a visually harmonious space that balances style with practicality, ensuring that each element complements the overall chic theme.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key substructures to optimize both functionality and aesthetic appeal. The Pedestal Sink Area is the focal point, featuring the sink itself and luxurious hand towels. The Mirror and Lighting Area includes the framed mirror and lighting fixtures, such as ceiling lights and wall sconces, to enhance the room's ambiance. The Sink Drainage System, while not requiring specific objects, is essential for the room's usability. These substructures guide the selection and placement of objects to maintain a cohesive and chic design.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Pedestal Sink Area, a chic white ceramic pedestal sink is recommended, accompanied by luxurious cotton hand towels and a metallic towel holder. The Mirror and Lighting Area features a chic silver-framed mirror, modern ceiling light, and two chic wall sconces to provide balanced illumination. Each object is selected for its style, dimensions, and functionality, ensuring they contribute to the room's elegant and harmonious aesthetic.

## 4. Scene Graph
The pedestal sink, a central element of the chic powder room, is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. Its dimensions are 0.656 meters in length, 0.491 meters in width, and 0.932 meters in height. This placement ensures the sink is a focal point, allowing for easy plumbing installation and mirror placement above, enhancing both functionality and style.

The framed mirror, measuring 0.8 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.0 meter, is positioned directly above the pedestal sink on the south wall. This alignment ensures users can easily use the mirror while washing their hands, maintaining the chic aesthetic and enhancing the room's functionality.

Hand towels, each measuring 0.29 meters by 0.101 meters by 0.096 meters, are placed on the south wall, one to the right and one to the left of the pedestal sink. This placement ensures they are within easy reach after hand washing, complementing the chic and luxurious setting.

The towel holder, with dimensions of 0.585 meters by 0.128 meters by 0.914 meters, is centrally placed above the pedestal sink on the south wall. This ensures it is functional and accessible, maintaining balance and symmetry around the sink area.

The ceiling light, measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.2 meters, is centrally placed on the ceiling to provide even illumination throughout the room. This placement enhances the room's functionality and aligns with the chic and luxurious theme.

Two wall sconces, each measuring 0.2 meters by 0.15 meters by 0.3 meters, are placed on the south wall, one to the right and one to the left of the framed mirror. This symmetrical placement enhances the mirror's illumination and adheres to the chic style, providing balanced lighting.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The objects were strategically placed to avoid spatial conflicts, ensuring each element complements the overall design. The room's layout supports the chic and functional aesthetic, with each object contributing to the harmonious and elegant ambiance envisioned by the user.

            - calculation:
                - Wall sconce size: 0.2 (length)
                - Cluster size (left of): max(0.0, 0.2) = 0.2
            - conclusion: Size constraint (left of): 0.2
        3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'south_wall' constraint
            - calculation:
                - Wall sconce size: length=0.2, width=0.15, height=0.3
                - Room size: 5.0x5.0x3.0
                - x_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 0.2/2 = 0.1
                - x_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 0.2/2 = 4.9
                - y_min = y_max = 0.075
                - z_min = z_max = 1.5
            - conclusion: Possible position: (0.1, 4.9, 0.075, 0.075, 1.5, 1.5)
        4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
            - calculation:
                - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.1-4.9), y(0.075-0.075)
                - Final coordinates: x=0.7608152168429678, y=0.075, z=1.6878334805641346
            - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.7608152168429678, y: 0.075, z: 1.6878334805641346
        5. reason: Collision check with other objects
            - calculation:
                - No collision detected with other objects
            - conclusion: No collision detected
        6. reason: Final position calculation
            - calculation:
                - Final coordinates: x=0.7608152168429678, y=0.075, z=1.6878334805641346
            - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.7608152168429678, y: 0.075, z: 1.6878334805641346
