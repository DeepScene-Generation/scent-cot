## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a farmhouse-style kitchen that incorporates key elements such as a ceramic double sink, a wooden kitchen island, and a hanging pot rack. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for these features. Additional elements include a wooden shelf for spices, an antique wooden hutch for displaying dishware, and a farmhouse dining table with chairs for casual dining. The user emphasizes a rustic aesthetic, complemented by a rustic ceiling light fixture to enhance illumination and ambiance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The kitchen is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Washing Area is designated for the ceramic double sink, positioned for optimal light and accessibility. The Central Preparation Area features the wooden kitchen island, serving as the main workspace. The Storage Area includes the hanging pot rack and wooden shelf, providing organized storage for cookware and spices. The Display Area is highlighted by the antique wooden hutch, showcasing dishware. Lastly, the Dining Area is centered around the farmhouse dining table and chairs, offering a space for casual meals.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Washing Area, a farmhouse-style ceramic double sink measuring 1.2 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.9 meters is recommended. The Central Preparation Area features a wooden kitchen island (2.0 meters by 1.0 meters by 0.9 meters) as the focal point. The Storage Area includes a metal hanging pot rack (1.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters) and a wooden shelf (1.5 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.0 meters) for spices. The Display Area is enhanced by an antique wooden hutch (1.15 meters by 0.398 meters by 2.152 meters). The Dining Area comprises a rustic brown farmhouse dining table (1.5 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.75 meters) and matching chairs (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.9 meters). A black metal ceiling light fixture (0.161 meters by 0.161 meters by 0.776 meters) is recommended for ambient lighting.

## 4. Scene Graph
The ceramic double sink is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, to serve as the central element of the kitchen. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.9m) fit well against the 5-meter wall, allowing for easy access and functionality while enhancing the rustic farmhouse style. The wooden kitchen island is centrally located in the room, facing the north wall. Its placement (2.0m x 1.0m x 0.9m) ensures it is a focal point, providing ample space for meal preparation and movement. The hanging pot rack is suspended from the ceiling above the kitchen island, parallel to its longer side, ensuring accessibility and alignment with the farmhouse style. The wooden shelf is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to facilitate access from both the sink and the kitchen island. The antique wooden hutch is positioned against the west wall, facing the east wall, providing a balanced focal point for dishware display. The farmhouse dining table is placed in the middle of the room, adjacent to the kitchen island, facing the north wall, allowing for ease of movement and complementing the kitchen's style. Chairs are placed to the right and left of the dining table, facing the west and east walls, respectively, ensuring practical seating and symmetry. The ceiling light is centrally located above the dining table, providing optimal lighting for the dining area.

## 5. Global Check
There are no conflicts detected in the layout, as all objects are placed without spatial overlap, maintaining the room's functional and aesthetic balance. The placement of each object aligns with the user's farmhouse kitchen vision, ensuring a cohesive and practical design.

For hutch_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No other objects in proximity
        - conclusion: No rotation difference applicable
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'west_wall' relation
        - calculation:
            - hutch_1 size: length=1.15, width=0.398
            - Cluster size (west_wall): 0.0 (non-directional)
        - conclusion: No directional constraint applied
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'west_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - Room size: 5.0x5.0x3.0
            - x_min = 0 + 0.398/2 = 0.199
            - x_max = 0 + 0.398/2 = 0.199
            - y_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 1.15/2 = 0.575
            - y_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 1.15/2 = 4.425
            - z_min = z_max = 2.152/2 = 1.076
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.199, 0.199, 0.575, 4.425, 1.076, 1.076)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
