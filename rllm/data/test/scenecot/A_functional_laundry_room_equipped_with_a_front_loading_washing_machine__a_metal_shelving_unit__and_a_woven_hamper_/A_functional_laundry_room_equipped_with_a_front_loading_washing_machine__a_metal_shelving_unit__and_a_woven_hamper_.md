## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a functional laundry room equipped with a front-loading washing machine, a metal shelving unit, and a woven hamper. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary focus is on functionality, with an emphasis on easy movement and accessibility. Additional elements such as a folding table, drying rack, and ceiling light are considered to enhance both the functionality and aesthetics of the space. The user also values a balance between modern and rustic styles, with a preference for a room that evokes freshness and comfort.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures: the Washing Machine Area on the south wall, the Metal Shelving Unit Area on the east wall, the Woven Hamper Area adjacent to the washing machine, and an Open Middle Area to facilitate movement. Additional substructures include a Folding Table Area for sorting clothes, a Drying Rack Area on the north wall for air-drying, and a Ceiling Light Area for illumination. Each substructure is designed to optimize workflow and accessibility, ensuring that the room remains functional and aesthetically pleasing.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Washing Machine Area, a modern front-loading washing machine with dimensions of 0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.85 meters is recommended. The Metal Shelving Unit Area requires a shelving unit with dimensions of 1.2 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.8 meters to store laundry supplies. The Woven Hamper Area features a rustic woven hamper measuring 0.5 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.6 meters. A folding table with dimensions of 1.0 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.75 meters is suggested for the Folding Table Area. The Drying Rack Area includes a minimalist drying rack measuring 1.0 meters by 0.5 meters by 1.0 meters. A bohemian-style rug (1.5 meters by 1.0 meters) is recommended for the Open Middle Area, and a contemporary ceiling light (0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.2 meters) is proposed for the Ceiling Light Area. Finally, a modern plastic laundry basket (0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.6 meters) is suggested for transporting clean clothes.

## 4. Scene Graph
The washing machine is a fundamental component of the laundry room, placed on the south wall to allow for plumbing and electrical connections. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 0.85m) ensure it fits comfortably while facing the north wall, maintaining accessibility and functionality. The woven hamper, placed to the right of the washing machine, facilitates easy transfer of dirty laundry. Its rustic style and dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.6m) complement the room's aesthetic while maintaining balance.

The drying rack is positioned on the north wall, facing the south wall, to allow for air circulation and easy access from the washing machine. Its minimalist design and dimensions (1.0m x 0.5m x 1.0m) ensure it does not obstruct movement. The bohemian rug is centrally placed in the room, adding comfort and visual interest without interfering with other objects. Its dimensions (1.5m x 1.0m) are suitable for the open area, enhancing the room's aesthetic.

The ceiling light is mounted centrally on the ceiling, providing even illumination throughout the room. Its contemporary style and dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.2m) complement the existing decor. The laundry basket is placed next to the woven hamper on the south wall, ensuring it is easily accessible for transporting clean clothes. Its modern design and dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.6m) fit well within the room's layout.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to the limited space available for the shelving unit and folding table, given the washing machine's placement. The shelving unit and folding table were both considered for deletion to resolve this issue. Ultimately, the shelving unit was removed, as the folding table's functionality for sorting clothes was deemed more essential to the room's workflow. This decision ensured the room maintained its functional layout while adhering to the user's preferences for a well-organized laundry space.
