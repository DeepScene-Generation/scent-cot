## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a bright artist's studio that incorporates essential elements such as an easel, canvas storage rack, and drafting table. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for creativity and functionality. The user's preferences emphasize a layout that includes distinct areas along the south, north, west, and east walls, as well as the middle of the room. The studio is designed to optimize natural light and maintain an organized, uncluttered environment, enhancing both the functionality and aesthetic appeal of the space.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The studio is divided into several key substructures based on the user's requirements. The central area is designated for the easel, ensuring optimal natural light and space for movement. The east wall hosts the drafting table area, facilitating sketching and planning. The south wall is reserved for canvas storage, maintaining organization. The west wall is allocated for art supplies storage, ensuring easy access to tools. Additional elements like a stool, task lamp, and rug are incorporated to enhance the studio's functionality and aesthetics.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central area, a modern wooden easel is recommended, measuring 0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.8 meters. The drafting table area features a contemporary metal and glass table (2.146 meters by 0.9 meters by 0.731 meters) and a matching stool (0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.6 meters). The canvas storage area includes a minimalist metal rack (1.0 meter by 0.5 meters by 1.5 meters). The west wall is equipped with a modern wooden art supplies cabinet (0.8 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.2 meters) and a minimalist wooden art shelf (1.0 meter by 0.3 meters by 1.8 meters). A modern metal task lamp (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters) is placed on the drafting table, and a bohemian wool rug (2.0 meters by 1.5 meters) defines the easel area.

## 4. Scene Graph
The easel is placed in the middle of the room to maximize natural light and provide ample space for movement, essential for an artist's studio. Its dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 1.8m) allow it to be a central focal point without feeling cramped. The easel faces the north wall, ensuring optimal lighting and viewing angles. The placement process involved ensuring the easel did not obstruct movement or access to other tools, aligning with the user's vision of a bright studio.

The drafting table is positioned against the east wall, facing the north wall, to utilize potential natural light and maintain open space in the room. Its dimensions (2.146m x 0.9m x 0.731m) fit well along the wall, ensuring functionality for sketching and planning. The stool is placed in front of the drafting table, facing the south wall, providing comfortable seating without obstructing movement. The task lamp is placed on the drafting table, offering focused lighting for detailed work.

The canvas storage rack is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, ensuring easy access to canvases without interfering with the easel or drafting table. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.5m x 1.5m) allow it to fit comfortably along the wall, maintaining balance in the room. The art supplies cabinet is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, creating a balanced layout with storage elements on opposite walls. Its dimensions (0.8m x 0.4m x 1.2m) ensure it does not obstruct movement or access to other areas.

The rug is placed under the easel in the middle of the room, defining the artistic workspace. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m) accommodate the easel's footprint, enhancing the room's aesthetic without disrupting the layout. The art shelf is placed on the west wall, to the right of the art supplies cabinet, facing the east wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.3m x 1.8m) ensure it is visible and accessible, contributing to the studio's purpose without obstructing movement.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. The layout effectively accommodates all objects, ensuring functionality and aesthetic appeal without spatial conflicts. The room's design principles and user preferences for a bright, organized studio are maintained throughout the arrangement.

            - Rotation difference: |90.0 - 90.0| = 0.0°
        - conclusion: Using length dimension for directional constraint
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'right of' relation
        - calculation:
            - art_supplies_cabinet_1 size: 0.8 (length)
            - Cluster size (right of): max(0.0, 0.8) = 0.8
        - conclusion: art_shelf_1 cluster size (right of): 0.8
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'west_wall' constraint
        - calculation:
            - art_shelf_1 size: length=1.0, width=0.3, height=1.8
            - x_min = 0 + 0.3/2 = 0.15
            - x_max = 0 + 0.3/2 = 0.15
            - y_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 1.0/2 = 0.5
            - y_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 1.0/2 = 4.5
            - z_min = z_max = 1.8/2 = 0.9
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.15, 0.15, 0.5, 4.5, 0.9, 0.9)
    4. reason: Adjust for 'right of art_supplies_cabinet_1' constraint
        - calculation:
            - x_min = max(0.15, 0.2 - 0.4/2 + 0.3/2) = 0.15
            - x_max = min(0.15, 0.2 + 0.4/2 - 0.3/2) = 0.25
            - y_min = max(0.5, 3.3471633761629977 - 0.8/2 - 1.0/2) = 2.447163376162998
            - y_max = min(4.5, 3.3471633761629977 - 0.8/2 - 1.0/2) = 2.447163376162998
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.15, y: 2.447163376162998, z: 0.9
    5. reason: Collision check with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No collision detected with other objects
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    6. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Final coordinates: x=0.15, y=2.447163376162998, z=0.9
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 0.15, y: 2.447163376162998, z: 0.9
