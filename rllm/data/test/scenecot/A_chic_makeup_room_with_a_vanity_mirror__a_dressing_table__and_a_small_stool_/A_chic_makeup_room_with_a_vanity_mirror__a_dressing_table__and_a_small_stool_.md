## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a chic makeup room that emphasizes elegance and functionality, primarily for makeup and hairstyling activities. The room is designed to include a vanity mirror, a dressing table, and a small stool, with minimalist artwork adorning the south wall and natural light streaming in from a window on the east wall. The aesthetic is chic and elegant, with a focus on soft, warm lighting and a minimalist design. The room should accommodate ergonomic seating aligned with the table height for a comfortable makeup routine, and the open middle area should facilitate easy movement while maintaining a minimalist design. Additional elements like organizers for makeup and beauty products are suggested to enhance functionality and maintain a chic, clutter-free ambiance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several key areas based on user requirements. The Vanity Area is the focal point, designed for detailed makeup application and hairstyling, requiring a dressing table, a large vanity mirror with lights, and a comfortable seating solution. The Seating Area ensures ergonomic comfort, aligning with the table height for a comfortable makeup routine. The Decorative Area includes minimalist artwork on the south wall to enhance the chic aesthetic. The Open Area in the middle of the room ensures easy movement and maintains a minimalist design, suggesting minimal furniture but perhaps a decorative rug to define the space without cluttering it.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Vanity Area, a chic white dressing table (1.2m x 0.5m x 0.75m) is recommended, accompanied by a modern silver vanity mirror (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.8m) and contemporary warm white vanity lights (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.1m). A chic cream stool (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.45m) is suggested for seating. To define the space, a minimalist light grey wool rug (1.5m x 1.5m x 0.01m) is proposed. For decor, a minimalist canvas artwork (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.5m) is recommended for the south wall. A modern transparent acrylic makeup organizer (0.087m x 0.087m x 0.043m) is suggested to maintain organization on the dressing table.

## 4. Scene Graph
The dressing table is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall, as it is the primary object for makeup and hairstyling. This placement makes efficient use of space and aligns with the user's preference for a chic makeup room. The dimensions (1.2m x 0.5m x 0.75m) fit comfortably against the wall, ensuring no spatial conflicts and providing adequate space for additional items like a stool and a vanity mirror.

The vanity mirror is mounted on the north wall directly above the dressing table, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.8m) allow it to be centered above the table, ensuring aesthetic balance and functional use. This placement maximizes functionality, as the mirror is at a suitable height for a person sitting at the table.

The vanity lights are mounted on the north wall, directly above the vanity mirror. They are positioned to align with the center of the dressing table and mirror, ensuring balanced illumination. The dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.1m) ensure they do not obstruct the mirror's function, enhancing the functional and aesthetic qualities of the makeup room setup.

The stool is placed in front of the dressing table, ensuring it is adjacent to the table and facing the north wall. This placement optimizes functionality for makeup activities and maintains a chic, cohesive aesthetic in the room. The stool's dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 0.45m) make it a suitable fit without overwhelming the space.

The rug is placed in the middle of the room under the stool and dressing table, creating a defined makeup space. It is centered with these objects to ensure both functionality and aesthetics are maintained, facing no particular wall but aligning with the furniture arrangement. Its dimensions (1.5m x 1.5m x 0.01m) allow it to fit comfortably without interfering with the functionality of the other objects.

The artwork is placed on the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures no spatial conflicts, aligns with the user's chic aesthetic preference, and adheres to design principles by balancing the room's visual elements. The artwork serves as a decorative focal point that enhances the overall ambiance of the makeup room.

The makeup organizer is placed on the dressing table, which is against the north wall, facing the south wall. It is adjacent to the dressing table, ensuring easy access and maintaining the room's chic and organized theme. Its small dimensions (0.087m x 0.087m x 0.043m) ensure it does not interfere with the space or the other objects.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict was identified with the placement of the makeup organizer and the perfume tray on the dressing table. The width of the makeup organizer was too small to accommodate the perfume tray beside it. To resolve this conflict, the perfume tray was removed, as the user's preference prioritized a chic makeup room with a vanity mirror, a dressing table, and a small stool. This decision maintained the room's functionality and aesthetic, adhering to the user's vision.
