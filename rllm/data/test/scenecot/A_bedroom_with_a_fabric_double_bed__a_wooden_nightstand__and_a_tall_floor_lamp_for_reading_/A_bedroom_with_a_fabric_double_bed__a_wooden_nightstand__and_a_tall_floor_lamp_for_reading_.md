## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user's primary goal is to create a bedroom focused on resting and reading activities. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The user has specified a preference for a fabric double bed, a wooden nightstand, and a tall floor lamp, emphasizing the need for ergonomic accessibility and visual balance. Additional preferences include a comfortable reading chair, a rug for warmth, a small bookshelf for storing books, and decorative elements like wall art or a plant to enhance the room's ambiance.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Rest Area is centered around the bed, providing a space for sleeping. The Nightstand Area is adjacent to the bed, serving as a convenient spot for personal items. The Lighting Setup is designed for reading, with a floor lamp positioned to provide adequate light. Additional substructures include a Reading Area, which incorporates a chair and bookshelf, and a Decorative Area, featuring a rug and wall art to enhance the room's aesthetic.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Rest Area, a contemporary fabric double bed measuring 2.0 meters by 1.8 meters by 0.5 meters is recommended. The Nightstand Area includes a wooden nightstand with dimensions of 0.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.6 meters. The Lighting Setup features a modern metal floor lamp, 1.8 meters tall with a 0.4-meter footprint. The Reading Area is complemented by a contemporary wooden bookshelf (0.8 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.5 meters) and a modern wool rug (2.0 meters by 2.0 meters) placed centrally. The Decorative Area includes a multicolor canvas wall art piece (1.0 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.7 meters) to add visual interest.

## 4. Scene Graph
The bed is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, to provide a clear walking path and space for additional furniture. Its dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.8 meters by 0.5 meters allow it to fit comfortably, maintaining balance and symmetry in the room. This placement aligns with the user's preference for a central sleeping area and ensures functionality and aesthetic appeal.

The nightstand is positioned to the left of the bed, adjacent to it, facing the north wall. With dimensions of 0.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.6 meters, it serves as a functional spot for personal items and complements the bed's placement. This arrangement maintains balance and adheres to user preferences for accessibility and convenience.

The floor lamp is placed to the right of the bed, adjacent to it, facing the north wall. Its height of 1.8 meters and 0.4-meter footprint ensure it provides adequate lighting for reading without spatial conflicts. This placement balances the nightstand on the left and enhances the room's functionality and aesthetic.

The rug is centrally placed in the room, measuring 2.0 meters by 2.0 meters, to provide a decorative element that anchors the space. Its thin profile ensures it does not obstruct movement or visibility, enhancing the room's aesthetic without hindering functionality.

The bookshelf is positioned on the east wall, facing the west wall, with dimensions of 0.8 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.5 meters. This placement provides easy access from the reading chair and complements the room's function and aesthetic by offering storage for books.

The wall art is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall, with dimensions of 1.0 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.7 meters. This placement enhances the room's aesthetic appeal without conflicting with other functional elements, adding color and interest to the space.

## 5. Global Check
During the placement process, several conflicts were identified. The south wall was too small to accommodate all intended objects, leading to the removal of the reading chair to prioritize the bed, nightstand, and floor lamp, which are more critical to the user's preferences. Additionally, the plant was removed due to spatial constraints near the bookshelf, ensuring the room's functionality and aesthetic are maintained without overcrowding.
