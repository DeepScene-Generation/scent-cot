## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a minimalist living room characterized by a white fabric sofa, a low coffee table, and a woven rug. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The design emphasizes simplicity and calmness, with a preference for a neutral color palette and clean lines. The functional needs include a seating area, a central coffee table area, and open space for gatherings, aligning with the user's desire for comfort and interaction. Additional elements such as a side table, floor lamp, wall art, decorative plant, and storage unit are considered to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal while maintaining the minimalist theme.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to meet the user's requirements. The Seating Area is defined by the placement of the sofa against the south wall, providing a focal point for relaxation. The Central Coffee Table Area is located in the middle of the room, facilitating interaction and serving as a gathering spot. The Open Space is maintained around these elements to ensure ease of movement and a sense of openness. Additional substructures include the Lighting Area, enhanced by a floor lamp for ambient lighting, and the Storage Area, positioned against the north wall for easy access and tidiness.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Seating Area, a minimalist white fabric sofa measuring 2.0 meters in length is recommended. The Central Coffee Table Area features a low wooden coffee table (1.2 meters by 0.6 meters) that complements the sofa. A woven rug (2.0 meters by 1.5 meters) is suggested to add warmth and define the seating arrangement. A wooden side table (0.5 meters by 0.5 meters) is proposed for convenience, while a metal floor lamp (0.3 meters by 0.3 meters by 1.7 meters) provides ambient lighting. Wall art in neutral tones (1.0 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.7 meters) enhances the aesthetic without cluttering the space. A decorative plant adds a natural element, and a wooden storage unit (1.0 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.2 meters) offers functionality and complements the minimalist design.

## 4. Scene Graph
The white fabric sofa is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, as it is a key element in the user's minimalist vision. Its dimensions (2.0m x 0.9m x 0.8m) ensure it fits well without overwhelming the space, maintaining balance and symmetry. This placement allows for easy movement and sets a focal point against the north wall, adhering to minimalist design principles.

The coffee table is centrally located in front of the sofa, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.4m) allow for comfortable legroom and accessibility, ensuring it does not obstruct movement. This placement aligns with the user's minimalist vision, providing balance and proportion to the room.

The woven rug is placed under the coffee table, centered in the middle of the room. Its dimensions (2.0m x 1.5m x 0.01m) are suitable for anchoring the seating arrangement, adding warmth and maintaining the minimalist aesthetic. The rug does not directly touch the sofa but complements the coffee table, enhancing the room's design.

The side table is positioned on the right side of the sofa, adjacent to it, facing the north wall. Its compact size (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.5m) ensures it fits without crowding the area, providing functionality and maintaining the room's open layout.

The floor lamp is placed on the south wall, right of the side table, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.7m) ensure it does not obstruct pathways, providing ambient lighting to the seating area and enhancing the room's functionality.

Wall art is mounted on the south wall above the sofa, facing the room. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.7m) add visual interest without causing spatial conflicts, complementing the sofa and maintaining the minimalist aesthetic.

The storage unit is placed on the north wall, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.4m x 1.2m) ensure it is easily accessible from the seating area, providing storage space while maintaining balance and proportion with the existing furniture.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose due to insufficient space on the south wall to accommodate all objects, specifically the floor lamp and decorative plant. The decorative plant was identified as the least critical to the user's preference for a minimalist living room, which prioritizes the white fabric sofa, low coffee table, and woven rug. Consequently, the decorative plant was removed to resolve the spatial conflict, ensuring the room's functionality and aesthetic remain intact.
