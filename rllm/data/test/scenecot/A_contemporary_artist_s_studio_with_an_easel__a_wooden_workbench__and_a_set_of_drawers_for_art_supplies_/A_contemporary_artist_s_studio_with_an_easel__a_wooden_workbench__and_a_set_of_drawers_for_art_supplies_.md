## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a contemporary artist's studio, emphasizing essential elements such as an easel, a wooden workbench, and a set of drawers for art supplies. The room is a square space measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample natural light, which is crucial for an artist's studio. The user desires a clean, uncluttered environment that allows for flexibility and creativity. While the primary focus is on functionality, the user also appreciates aesthetic enhancements, such as a comfortable artist chair, a large rug for added comfort, and a few plants to introduce a touch of nature. The design aims to balance utility and contemporary style, ensuring the studio supports the artist's workflow and creative process.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The studio is divided into key areas based on the user's requirements. The Drawer Unit Area is designated for storage, ensuring art supplies are organized and accessible. The Easel Area is central to the studio, providing a space for painting and sketching. The Workbench Area is intended for art preparation, offering a functional workspace. Additionally, an Open Flex Space is maintained for movement and flexibility, allowing the artist to navigate the studio freely and adapt the space as needed.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Easel Area, a contemporary wooden easel with dimensions of 0.698 meters by 0.523 meters by 1.291 meters is recommended, providing a functional and aesthetic focal point for painting. The Workbench Area features a substantial wooden workbench measuring 2.0 meters by 0.8 meters by 1.0 meter, suitable for art preparation. The Drawer Unit Area includes a contemporary white wooden drawer unit (1.0 meters by 0.5 meters by 0.8 meters) for storing art supplies. To enhance comfort and style, a black metal artist chair (0.557 meters by 0.617 meters by 0.931 meters) is suggested, along with a gray fabric rug (3.0 meters by 2.0 meters) for the Open Flex Space. Decorative elements include two modern green ceramic plants and a silver metal light fixture to provide focused lighting.

## 4. Scene Graph
The easel, a central element for painting and sketching, is placed in the middle of the room, facing the north wall. This placement ensures optimal functionality, allowing the artist to move freely around it and maintain a clear view of the artwork. The easel's natural wood color complements the contemporary style, and its central position provides balance and symmetry within the studio.

The workbench is positioned against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement ensures it does not obstruct the easel while remaining accessible for art preparation. The workbench's dark wood complements the easel, enhancing the studio's aesthetic and maintaining a clear, functional workspace.

The drawer unit is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. This location provides easy access to art supplies without interfering with the primary work areas. The drawer unit's white color and contemporary style align with the studio's aesthetic, ensuring balance and proportion.

The artist chair is placed in front of the workbench, facing the south wall. This positioning supports the functionality of the workbench, providing comfortable seating for the artist. The chair's black metal design complements the studio's contemporary style, maintaining balance and proportion.

The rug is placed under the artist chair and easel, defining the work area in the middle of the room. Its size fits well within the space, providing comfort and enhancing the studio's aesthetic without obstructing functionality.

Plant 1 is placed in the south-east corner, facing the north wall. This decorative element adds a touch of nature, enhancing the studio's ambiance without obstructing the workspace. Plant 2 is positioned in the north-west corner, facing the east wall, creating visual balance and symmetry with Plant 1.

The light fixture is suspended from the ceiling, directly above the easel, providing focused lighting essential for art creation. Its contemporary design and silver color complement the studio's aesthetic, enhancing functionality and maintaining the room's visual appeal.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were positioned to ensure functionality and aesthetic appeal, adhering to the user's vision for a contemporary artist's studio. The arrangement maintains open pathways and clear access to all areas, supporting the artist's workflow and creative process.
