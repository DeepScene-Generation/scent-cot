## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a contemporary bedroom that emphasizes minimalism and functionality. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. Key elements include a double bed, a wooden nightstand, and a black upholstered office chair. The user prioritizes a minimalist aesthetic, focusing on essential furniture pieces that provide both functionality and style. Additional elements like a bedside lamp, a small rug, and decorative art are suggested to enhance the room's aesthetic appeal while maintaining a cohesive and inviting atmosphere.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into three main substructures to meet the user's requirements: the Bed and Nightstand Area, the Office Chair Workspace, and the Open Movement Area. The Bed and Nightstand Area is designed to accommodate the double bed and nightstand, providing storage and space for a bedside lamp. The Office Chair Workspace is intended for the ergonomic office chair, facilitating work or relaxation while complementing the modern aesthetic. The Open Movement Area ensures ample space around the furniture for ease of movement, maintaining the room's minimalist design.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Bed and Nightstand Area, a contemporary double bed measuring 2.0 meters by 1.8 meters by 0.5 meters and a wooden nightstand measuring 0.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.6 meters are recommended. The Office Chair Workspace features a black upholstered office chair with dimensions of 0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 1.0 meter. Additional objects include a contemporary bedside lamp (0.2 meters by 0.2 meters by 0.5 meters), a neutral wool rug (1.2 meters by 1.8 meters by 0.02 meters), decorative art (1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 0.7 meters), and a green ceramic plant (0.4 meters by 0.4 meters by 1.0 meter) to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 4. Scene Graph
The double bed is a central piece of furniture in the bedroom, placed against the north wall and facing the south wall. This positioning allows for balance and accessibility, leaving space for nightstands on either side. The bed's dimensions (2.0m x 1.8m x 0.5m) fit well within the room, maintaining a contemporary style and ensuring functionality. The wooden nightstand is placed adjacent to the bed on its left side, against the north wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.4m x 0.6m) ensure it fits comfortably beside the bed, providing convenient storage and enhancing the room's aesthetic.

The office chair is positioned on the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement allows it to function effectively as a seating area, maintaining the contemporary aesthetic without a desk. The chair's dimensions (0.6m x 0.6m x 1.0m) ensure it fits comfortably without conflicting with other furniture. The bedside lamp is placed on the nightstand, providing functional lighting and complementing the room's contemporary design. Its small size (0.2m x 0.2m x 0.5m) ensures it fits well on the nightstand, enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic.

The rug is placed under the foot of the bed, facing the south wall, with its longer side parallel to the bed's width. This placement ensures comfort when stepping out of bed and enhances the room's aesthetic. The rug's dimensions (1.2m x 1.8m x 0.02m) allow it to fit comfortably without interfering with the office chair. The decorative art is placed on the west wall, facing the east wall. This placement makes it a focal point upon entering the room, adding visual interest without crowding other functional areas. The plant is placed in the south-east corner, adjacent to the east wall, facing the west wall. This placement enhances the room's aesthetic without disrupting functionality, maintaining an open movement area.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects were placed in a manner that respects the user's preferences for a contemporary style and maintains the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal. The placement of each object ensures no spatial conflicts, adhering to design principles of balance and proportion.
