## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user envisions a cozy breakfast nook within a room measuring 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary focus is on creating an inviting space centered around a small kitchen table, accompanied by two chairs and a decorative glass jar. The user emphasizes a rustic aesthetic, with the table serving both functional and aesthetic purposes. Additional elements such as a small rug, wall art, and a shelf are considered to enhance the room's coziness and functionality, while maintaining a clear and inviting atmosphere with no more than ten objects.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures to meet the user's requirements. The central area is designated for the kitchen table and chairs, forming the core of the breakfast nook. The surrounding space accommodates additional elements like a rug for comfort and decor, wall art for aesthetic enhancement, and a shelf for storage and display. Each substructure is designed to contribute to the overall cozy and inviting ambiance of the nook.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the central area, a rustic wooden kitchen table measuring 1.2 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended, accompanied by two matching rustic oak chairs, each measuring 0.41 meters by 0.388 meters by 0.612 meters. A minimalist glass jar, measuring 0.181 meters by 0.181 meters by 0.201 meters, is suggested as a decorative centerpiece. A bohemian-style wool rug, measuring 2.0 meters by 1.5 meters, is proposed to enhance comfort and decor. Modern wall art on canvas, measuring 1.0 meter by 0.05 meters by 0.7 meters, and a contemporary white wooden shelf, measuring 1.0 meter by 0.3 meters by 0.2 meters, are recommended to complete the aesthetic and functional needs of the room.

## 4. Scene Graph
The kitchen table is placed centrally in the room, facing the north wall, to serve as the focal point of the breakfast nook. This placement allows for easy access and movement around the table, aligning with the user's vision of a cozy and functional space. The table's rustic style enhances the room's aesthetic, while its central location ensures balance and proportion.

Chair 1 is positioned to the right of the kitchen table, facing the west wall. This placement ensures functional seating during meals and complements the table's rustic oak finish, contributing to the cozy ambiance. The chair's dimensions allow it to fit comfortably without spatial conflicts, maintaining balance and proportion in the room.

Chair 2 is placed to the left of the kitchen table, facing the east wall, to create a symmetrical and balanced seating arrangement. This positioning ensures both chairs are adjacent to the table, providing easy access and maintaining the cozy atmosphere desired by the user.

The glass jar is centrally placed on the kitchen table as a decorative element. Its minimalist design and small size ensure it does not disrupt the table's functionality or the room's balance. The jar enhances the visual appeal of the nook, aligning with the user's aesthetic preferences.

The bohemian rug is placed under the kitchen table and chairs, in the middle of the room. This placement visually anchors the seating area, enhancing comfort and decor without hindering movement. The rug's multicolor design complements the rustic and cozy theme of the nook.

Wall art is placed on the south wall, facing the middle of the room. This positioning ensures the art is visible and enhances the room's aesthetic as soon as someone enters. The varied colors of the art complement the rustic and bohemian elements, maintaining visual balance and proportion.

The shelf is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement provides stability and maximizes storage and display accessibility without obstructing the view or access to other functional areas. The shelf's contemporary style adds a modern contrast to the rustic theme, enhancing the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects fit comfortably within the room's dimensions, maintaining the user's vision of a cozy and inviting breakfast nook. The arrangement ensures balance, proportion, and functionality, with each object contributing to the overall aesthetic and practical needs of the space.
