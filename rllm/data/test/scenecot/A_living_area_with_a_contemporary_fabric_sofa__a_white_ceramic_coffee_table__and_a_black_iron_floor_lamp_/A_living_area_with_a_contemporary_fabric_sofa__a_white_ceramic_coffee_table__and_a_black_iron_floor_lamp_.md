## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user has specified a desire for a contemporary living area that includes a fabric sofa, a white ceramic coffee table, and a black iron floor lamp. The room dimensions are 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, providing ample space for additional functional and aesthetic enhancements. The user emphasizes a contemporary style, suggesting a preference for sleek, modern furniture and decor that enhances both functionality and visual appeal.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The living area is divided into three key zones based on the user's requirements: the Sofa Area for relaxation and guest entertainment, the Coffee Table Area for central placement and visual balance, and the Floor Lamp Area for ambient and reading lighting. These zones are designed to enhance the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal, ensuring a cohesive and inviting living space.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sofa Area, a contemporary fabric sofa is recommended, complemented by a side table and a decorative throw pillow to enhance comfort and style. In the Coffee Table Area, a white ceramic coffee table is suggested, along with a decorative centerpiece such as a vase to add visual interest. The Floor Lamp Area features a black iron floor lamp, with a small side table providing additional surface space. A rug beneath the coffee table defines the seating area and adds warmth, while a sleek media console offers storage for electronics. Wall art or a large mirror enhances the room's aesthetic and creates a sense of depth.

## 4. Scene Graph
The contemporary fabric sofa is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall. This placement makes the sofa the focal point of the living area, aligning with the user's preference for a contemporary style. The sofa's dimensions (2.5m x 1.0m x 0.9m) fit comfortably along the south wall, leaving ample room for other objects. This setup ensures balance and proportion, enhancing both comfort and aesthetics.

The coffee table is centrally placed in front of the sofa, maintaining a comfortable distance for use. Its dimensions (1.2m x 0.6m x 0.45m) allow it to fit without overwhelming the space. Positioned in the middle of the room, it aligns with the sofa's orientation, providing a central point for the living area and enhancing the room's aesthetics.

The floor lamp, a contemporary black iron fixture, is placed on the south wall, to the left of the sofa. Its slim profile (0.3m x 0.3m x 1.8m) allows it to fit comfortably without consuming much space. This placement provides reading light and contributes to the ambient lighting of the room, enhancing the space without being intrusive.

The side table is placed to the right of the sofa, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.5m) allow it to fit comfortably without obstructing existing furniture. This placement balances the room layout, complementing the sofa and maintaining the functionality of the space.

The decorative throw pillow is placed on the right side of the sofa, enhancing the aesthetic of the contemporary living space. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.2m x 0.5m) ensure it fits without cluttering the layout, complementing the existing furniture and maintaining the room's contemporary style.

The vase, a decorative glass piece, is placed on the coffee table. Its small size (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.4m) fits well without obstructing the table's use. This placement allows it to be a focal point, adding to the aesthetic appeal without disrupting functionality.

The rug is placed on the floor in the middle of the room, directly under the coffee table. Its large size (3.0m x 2.0m) fits comfortably, defining the coffee table area and adding aesthetic value. This placement creates a cohesive look and visually anchors the coffee table to the space.

The media console is placed against the north wall, facing the south wall (sofa). Its dimensions (1.8m x 0.5m x 0.7m) ensure it fits comfortably without impeding other objects. This placement supports the intended use of the console within the living area, contributing to the overall contemporary aesthetic.

The wall art is placed on the south wall, centered above the sofa. Its size (0.95m x 0.02m x 1.4m) is proportionate to the wall space available, maintaining balance and avoiding clutter. This placement enhances the room's visual appeal, acting as a focal point when seated on the sofa.

## 5. Global Check
No conflicts were identified during the placement process. All objects fit comfortably within the room's dimensions, maintaining the user's preference for a contemporary style and ensuring functionality and aesthetic appeal. The arrangement adheres to design principles, ensuring balance, proportion, and a cohesive living space.

For vase_1
- parent object: coffee_table_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with coffee_table_1
        - calculation:
            - Rotation of vase_1: 0.0°
            - Rotation of coffee_table_1: 0.0°
            - Rotation difference: |0.0 - 0.0| = 0.0°
        - conclusion: Using length dimension for directional constraint
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'on' relation
        - calculation:
            - vase_1 size: 0.3 (length)
            - Cluster size (on): max(0.0, 0.3) = 0.3
        - conclusion: vase_1 cluster size (on): 0.3
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'coffee_table_1' constraint
        - calculation:
            - vase_1 size: length=0.3, width=0.3, height=0.4
            - x_min = 1.9019299969126862 - 1.2/2 + 0.3/2 = 1.451929996912686
            - x_max = 1.9019299969126862 + 1.2/2 - 0.3/2 = 2.3519299969126863
            - y_min = 2.488902559188974 - 0.6/2 + 0.3/2 = 2.3389025591889743
            - y_max = 2.488902559188974 + 0.6/2 - 0.3/2 = 2.638902559188974
            - z_min = z_max = 0.65
        - conclusion: Possible position: (1.451929996912686, 2.3519299969126863, 2.3389025591889743, 2.638902559188974, 0.65, 0.65)
