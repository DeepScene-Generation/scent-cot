## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user has specified a room size of 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters, aiming to create a comfortable and classic bedroom. The primary elements include a double bed with fabric upholstery, two wooden nightstands, and a classic wardrobe, which are essential for sleeping, bedside access, and storage. The user also desires additional objects to enhance functionality and aesthetic appeal, such as bedside lamps for practical lighting, a rug for warmth and texture, a wall mirror for visual space enhancement, and a decorative piece or artwork to add personality and serve as a focal point.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several functional substructures based on the user's requirements. The Sleeping Area is centered around the double bed, providing a comfortable space for rest. The Bedside Area includes the nightstands, offering convenient storage and lighting. The Storage Area is designated for the wardrobe, ensuring ample space for clothing. The Decorative Area features the artwork and mirror, enhancing the room's aesthetic and functional appeal. Finally, the Central Area is defined by the rug, creating a cozy and inviting space.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Sleeping Area, a classic double bed with dimensions of 2.0 meters by 1.8 meters by 0.6 meters is recommended. The Bedside Area includes two classic wooden nightstands, each measuring 0.5 meters by 0.4 meters by 0.6 meters, complemented by classic bronze metal lamps for lighting. The Storage Area features a classic wardrobe with dimensions of 1.5 meters by 0.6 meters by 2.0 meters, providing ample clothing storage. The Decorative Area includes a classic-style mirror (1.0 meters by 0.05 meters by 1.5 meters) and a piece of artwork (1.0 meters by 0.05 meters by 0.8 meters) to enhance visual appeal. The Central Area is defined by a patterned rug measuring 2.5 meters by 2.5 meters, adding warmth and texture to the room.

## 4. Scene Graph
The double bed is placed against the south wall, facing the north wall, as it is the focal point of the room and essential for sleeping. This placement maximizes floor space and facilitates easy movement, aligning with the user's preference for a comfortable bedroom setup. The bed's dimensions (2.0m x 1.8m x 0.6m) fit well against the wall, maintaining balance and proportion in the room.

Nightstand_1 is positioned on the left side of the bed, adjacent to it, facing the north wall. This placement ensures easy access from the bed and maintains a balanced and symmetrical appearance. The nightstand's dimensions (0.5m x 0.4m x 0.6m) allow it to fit comfortably next to the bed without occupying excessive space, complementing the bed's neutral fabric upholstery.

Nightstand_2 is placed on the right side of the bed, also facing the north wall, to maintain symmetry and functionality. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.4m x 0.6m) fit comfortably within the available space, providing balance and convenient storage.

The wardrobe is placed on the east wall, facing the west wall, ensuring stability and accessibility for clothing storage. Its dimensions (1.5m x 0.6m x 2.0m) fit well on the wall, avoiding congestion around the bed and maintaining an open pathway for movement.

Lamp_1 is placed on nightstand_1, providing lighting for the bed area. Its dimensions (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.6m) fit comfortably on the nightstand, enhancing the room's classic aesthetic and functionality.

Lamp_2 is placed on nightstand_2, ensuring even lighting on both sides of the bed. Its placement maintains balance and symmetry, aligning with the room's classic style.

The rug is placed in the middle of the room, serving as a focal point and complementing the surrounding furniture. Its dimensions (2.5m x 2.5m) allow it to enhance the room's comfort and aesthetic appeal without interfering with existing furniture.

The mirror is placed adjacent to the wardrobe on the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 1.5m) fit well on the wall, providing functionality for dressing and enhancing the room's visual space.

The artwork is placed on the south wall, centered above the bed, facing the north wall. Its dimensions (1.0m x 0.05m x 0.8m) fit comfortably above the bed, creating a balanced look and serving as a decorative focal point.

## 5. Global Check
There were no conflicts identified during the placement process. All objects were placed without spatial conflicts, maintaining the room's functionality and aesthetic appeal. The placement of each object aligns with the user's preferences and design principles, ensuring a comfortable and classic bedroom setup.

            - rug_1 size: 2.5x2.5x0.02
            - Cluster size (middle of the room): 0.0 (non-directional)
        - conclusion: No directional constraint applied
    2. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'middle of the room' constraint
        - calculation:
            - x_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 2.5/2 = 1.25
            - x_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 2.5/2 = 3.75
            - y_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 2.5/2 = 1.25
            - y_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 2.5/2 = 3.75
            - z_min = z_max = 0.02/2 = 0.01
        - conclusion: Possible position: (1.25, 3.75, 1.25, 3.75, 0.01, 0.01)
    3. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(1.25-3.75), y(1.25-3.75)
            - Final coordinates: x=2.7224, y=1.9564, z=0.01
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 2.7224, y: 1.9564, z: 0.01
    4. reason: Collision check with bed_1
        - calculation:
            - Overlap detection: 1.25 ≤ 2.7224 ≤ 3.75 → No collision
        - conclusion: No collision detected
    5. reason: Final position calculation
        - calculation:
            - Selected position within overlap: x=2.7224, y=1.9564, z=0.01
        - conclusion: Final position: x: 2.7224, y: 1.9564, z: 0.01
