## 1. Requirement Analysis
The user desires a classic study room featuring specific furniture pieces, including a mahogany desk, a leather reclining chair, and bookcases. These elements are crucial for both the room's functionality and its aesthetic appeal. The room measures 5.0 meters by 5.0 meters with a ceiling height of 3.0 meters. The primary functions of the room are to provide a workspace, comfortable seating, and ample storage for books, aligning with the user's preference for a classic and sophisticated style.

## 2. Area Decomposition
The room is divided into several substructures to fulfill the user's requirements. The Mahogany Desk Area serves as the central workspace, while the Leather Reclining Chair Area provides a comfortable seating arrangement. The Bookcase Storage Area is designated for storing books, and the Overhead Light Fixture ensures adequate lighting. Each substructure plays a vital role in maintaining the room's classic aesthetic and functional needs.

## 3. Object Recommendations
For the Mahogany Desk Area, a classic mahogany desk with dimensions of 1.8 meters by 0.8 meters by 0.75 meters is recommended, accompanied by a classic metal desk lamp and a wooden desk organizer. The Leather Reclining Chair Area features a classic leather chair measuring 1.073 meters by 0.851 meters by 0.975 meters, complemented by a wooden side table. The Bookcase Storage Area includes a classic wooden bookcase (0.859 meters by 0.224 meters by 1.979 meters) and a brass bookend. The Overhead Light Fixture is a classic metal light with dimensions of 0.6 meters by 0.6 meters by 0.3 meters, and a floor lamp is suggested for focused lighting near the chair.

## 4. Scene Graph
The mahogany desk is placed centrally against the north wall, facing the south wall. This placement is chosen to make the desk the focal point of the room, providing a clear view and ample space for movement. The desk's dimensions (1.8m x 0.8m x 0.75m) fit comfortably against the 5.0-meter-wide wall, allowing for additional furniture on either side.

The desk lamp, classic in style and made of metal, is placed on the mahogany desk to provide lighting for writing and reading. Its small size (0.3m x 0.3m x 0.5m) ensures it does not overwhelm the desk space, maintaining functionality and aesthetic harmony.

The desk organizer, made of wood and matching the desk's classic style, is placed on the desk to the left of the lamp. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.2m x 0.3m) allow it to fit without cluttering the space, enhancing the desk's functionality by organizing papers.

The leather reclining chair is positioned in front of the desk, facing the north wall. This placement ensures a functional seating arrangement for reading or working, with the chair's dimensions (1.073m x 0.851m x 0.975m) fitting comfortably without obstructing movement.

The side table is placed to the right of the chair, facing the east wall. Its dimensions (0.5m x 0.5m x 0.6m) allow it to hold items conveniently while maintaining space for movement around the chair and desk.

The bookcase is placed against the east wall, facing the west wall. Its dimensions (0.859m x 0.224m x 1.979m) fit well along the wall, providing storage without obstructing the room's flow. The bookend is placed on a shelf within the bookcase, enhancing book organization while maintaining the classic aesthetic.

The overhead light is installed centrally on the ceiling, providing balanced illumination throughout the room. Its placement ensures it does not interfere with any objects, aligning with the classic style and enhancing the room's aesthetic appeal.

The floor lamp is positioned to the left of the chair, facing the south wall. Its dimensions (0.4m x 0.4m x 1.5m) ensure it provides focused lighting for reading without obstructing pathways or other objects.

## 5. Global Check
A conflict arose regarding the placement of bookcase_2 and the step stool. The width of bookcase_2 was too small to accommodate the step stool to its right, and the width of bookcase_1 was insufficient to accommodate bookcase_2 to its left. To resolve this, the step stool was removed, as the user's preference for a classic study with a set of bookcases took precedence. This decision maintained the room's functionality and aesthetic coherence.

For overhead_light_1
- calculation_steps:
    1. reason: Calculate rotation difference with other objects
        - calculation:
            - No rotation difference applicable
        - conclusion: No directional constraint applied
    2. reason: Calculate size constraint for 'on' relation
        - calculation:
            - No size constraint applicable
        - conclusion: No directional constraint applied
    3. reason: Calculate possible positions based on 'ceiling' constraint
        - calculation:
            - overhead_light_1 size: length=0.6, width=0.6, height=0.3
            - x_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 0.6/2 = 0.3
            - x_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 0.6/2 = 4.7
            - y_min = 2.5 - 5.0/2 + 0.6/2 = 0.3
            - y_max = 2.5 + 5.0/2 - 0.6/2 = 4.7
            - z_min = z_max = 2.85
        - conclusion: Possible position: (0.3, 4.7, 0.3, 4.7, 2.85, 2.85)
    4. reason: Adjust boundaries for valid placement
        - calculation:
            - Adjusted cluster constraint: x(0.3-4.7), y(0.3-4.7)
